Nearsightedness,"Nearsightedness symptoms may include: Blurry vision when looking at distant objects. The need to squint or partially close the eyelids to see clearly. Headaches. Eyestrain. School-age children may have difficulty seeing things on whiteboards or screen projections in the classroom. Younger children might not express difficulty seeing, but they may have the following behaviors that suggest difficulty seeing: Constant squinting. Seeming to not be aware of distant objects. Blinking often. Rubbing the eyes often. Sitting close to the television or moving screens closer to the face. Adults with nearsightedness may notice difficulty reading street signs or signs in stores. Some people may experience blurry vision in dim light, as with nighttime driving, even if they see clearly in daylight. This condition is called night myopia. When to see a doctor Make an appointment with an eye care specialist if your child shows any signs of vision problems or if a teacher reports possible problems. Make an appointment for yourself if you notice a change in your vision, have difficulty performing tasks such as driving or find that the quality of your vision affects your enjoyment of activities. Seek emergency medical care if you experience any of the following: Sudden appearance of many floaters — tiny specks or lines that seem to drift through your field of vision. Flashes of light in one or both eyes. A curtain-like gray shadow covering all or part of your field of vision. A shadow in your outer or side vision, known as peripheral vision. These are warnings signs of the retina becoming detached from the back of the eye. This condition is a medical emergency requiring prompt treatment. Significant nearsightedness is associated with an increased risk of retinal detachment. Regular eye exams Both children and adults may not be aware of problems with vision or changes that happen gradually. The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends regular vision screenings to ensure timely diagnosis and treatment. Children and adolescents Your child's pediatrician or other healthcare professional does relatively simple exams to check the health of your child's eyes at birth, between 6 and 12 months of age, and between 12 and 36 months of age. If there are any problems, you may be referred to a doctor specializing in eye health and care, called an ophthalmologist. Vision screenings are tests to check for vision problems. A screening test may be done by a pediatrician, an ophthalmologist, an optometrist or another trained provider. Vision screenings are often offered at schools or community centers. The recommended times for screening are as follows: At least once between ages 3 and 5. Before kindergarten, usually age 5 or 6. Annually through the end of high school. If a problem is found in a screening test, you'll likely need to schedule a complete eye exam with an optometrist or ophthalmologist. Adults The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends that healthy adults with no known problems with vision or eye disease should get a complete eye exam on the following schedule: At least once between ages 20 and 29. At least twice between ages 30 and 39. Every 2 to 4 years from ages 40 to 54. Every 1 to 3 years from ages 55 to 64. Every 1 to 2 years after age 65. If you have diabetes, a family history of eye disease, high blood pressure, or other risks of heart or vascular disease, you'll likely need more-regular eye exams. Also, you'll likely need more-regular exams if you already have prescription glasses or contacts or if you've had surgery for vision correction. Your healthcare professional or eye care specialist can recommend how often to get an exam. Request an appointment"

Many people develop lines or ridges from the cuticle to the tip. Rachel Miest, M.D., Department of Dermatology, Mayo Clinic: Those are actually completely fine and just a part of normal aging. Ms. Williams: But Dr. Rachel Miest says there are other nail changes you should not ignore that may indicate … Dr. Miest: liver problems, kidney problems, nutritional deficiencies … Ms. Williams: And other issues. Here are six examples: No. 1 is pitting. This could be a sign of psoriasis. Two is clubbing. Clubbing happens when your oxygen is low and could be a sign of lung issues. Three is spooning. It can happen if you have iron-deficient anemia or liver disease. Four is called ""a Beau's line."" It's a horizontal line that indicates a previous injury or infection. Five is nail separation. This may happen as a result of injury, infection or a medication. And six is yellowing of the nails, which may be the result of chronic bronchitis.

Prescription drug abuse,"Signs and symptoms of prescription drug abuse depend on the specific drug. Because of their mind-altering properties, the most misused prescription drugs are: Opioids used to treat pain, such as medicines containing oxycodone (Oxycontin, Percocet) and those containing hydrocodone (Norco) Anti-anxiety medicines, sedatives and hypnotics used to treat anxiety and sleep disorders, such as alprazolam (Xanax), diazepam (Valium) and zolpidem (Ambien) Stimulants used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and certain sleep disorders, such as methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta, others), dextroamphetamine-amphetamine (Adderall XR, Mydayis) and dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) Signs and symptoms of prescription drug abuse Opioids Constipation Nausea Feeling high Slowed breathing rate Drowsiness Confusion Poor coordination Increased dose needed for pain relief Worsening or increased sensitivity to pain with higher doses Anti-anxiety medicines and sedatives Drowsiness Confusion Unsteady walking Slurred speech Poor concentration Dizziness Problems with memory Slowed breathing Stimulants Increased alertness Feeling high Irregular heartbeat High blood pressure High body temperature Reduced appetite Insomnia Agitation Anxiety Paranoia Other signs Forging, stealing or selling prescriptions Taking higher doses than prescribed Being hostile or having mood swings Sleeping less or more Making poor decisions Being unusually energetic, high or revved up Being drowsy Requesting early refills or continually ""losing"" prescriptions, so more prescriptions must be written Trying to get prescriptions from more than one prescriber When to see a doctor Talk with your health care provider if you think you may have a problem with prescription drug use.

Premenstrual syndrome (PMS),
Primary ovarian insufficiency,"Symptoms of primary ovarian insufficiency are like those of menopause or low estrogen. They include: Irregular or missed periods. This symptom might be present for years. It also could develop after a pregnancy or after stopping birth control pills. Trouble getting pregnant. Hot flashes and night sweats. Vaginal dryness. Anger, depression or anxiety. Trouble with focus or memory. Less sexual desire. When to see a doctor If you've missed your period for three months or more, see your health care team to figure out the cause. You can miss your period for many reasons, such as pregnancy, stress, or a change in diet or exercise habits. But it's best to get a health care checkup whenever your menstrual cycle changes. Even if you don't mind not having periods, see a health care professional to find out what's causing the change. Low estrogen levels can lead to a condition that causes weak and brittle bones, called osteoporosis. Low levels of estrogen also can lead to heart disease. Request an appointment"
Premature ejaculation,"The main symptom of premature ejaculation is not being able to delay ejaculation for more than three minutes after penetration. But it might occur in all sexual situations, even during masturbation. Premature ejaculation can be classified as: Lifelong. Lifelong premature ejaculation occurs all or nearly all the time beginning with the first sexual encounter. Acquired. Acquired premature ejaculation develops after having previous sexual experiences without problems with ejaculation. Many people feel that they have symptoms of premature ejaculation, but the symptoms don't meet the criteria for a diagnosis. It's typical to experience early ejaculation at times. When to see a doctor Talk with your health care provider if you ejaculate sooner than you wish during most sexual encounters. It's common to feel embarrassed about discussing sexual health concerns. But don't let that keep you from talking to your provider. Premature ejaculation is common and treatable. A conversation with a care provider might help lessen concerns. For example, it might be reassuring to hear that it's typical to experience premature ejaculation from time to time. It may also help to know that the average time from the beginning of intercourse to ejaculation is about five minutes. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Premature birth,"Your baby may have very mild symptoms of premature birth or more-serious health problems. Some signs of being born too early include: Small size, with a head that's large compared with the body. Features that are sharper and less rounded than a full-term baby's features due to a lack of cells that store fat. Fine hair that covers much of the body. Low body temperature, mainly right after birth in the delivery room. Trouble breathing. Feeding problems. The following tables show the median birth weight, length and head circumference of premature babies at different gestational ages for each sex. Weight, length and head circumference by gestational age for boys Gestational age Weight Length Head circumference 40 weeks 7 lbs., 15 oz. (3.6 kg) 20 in. (51 cm) 13.8 in.

(21 cm) Special care If you give birth to a preterm baby, your baby will likely need to stay in a special nursery unit at the hospital. Some infants need to spend time in a unit that cares for them and closely tracks their health day and night. This is called a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). A step down from the NICU is an intermediate care nursery, which provides less intensive care. Special nursery units are staffed with health care providers and a team that's trained to help preterm babies. Your baby may need extra help feeding and adapting right after delivery. Your health care team can help you understand what's needed and what your baby's care plan will be. Feel free to ask them questions. Request an appointment"
Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome,"The heart rate is the number of times the heart beats each minute. A fast heart rate is called tachycardia (tak-ih-KAHR-dee-uh). The most common symptom of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a heart rate greater than 100 beats a minute. In WPW syndrome, the fast heartbeat can begin suddenly. It may last a few seconds or several hours. Episodes may occur during exercise or while at rest. Other symptoms of WPW syndrome may depend on the speed of the heartbeat and the underlying heart rhythm disorder. For example, the most common irregular heartbeat seen with WPW syndrome is supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). During an episode of SVT , the heart beats about 150 to 220 times a minute, but it can occasionally beat faster or slower. Some people with WPW syndrome also have a fast and chaotic heart rhythm disorder called atrial fibrillation. In general, symptoms of WPW syndrome include: Rapid, fluttering or pounding heartbeats. Chest pain. Difficulty breathing. Dizziness or lightheadedness. Fainting. Fatigue. Shortness of breath. Anxiety. Symptoms in infants Infants with WPW may have other symptoms, such as: Blue or gray skin, lips and nails. These changes may be harder or easier to see depending on skin color. Restlessness or irritability. Rapid breathing. Poor eating. Some people with an extra electrical pathway don't have symptoms of a fast heartbeat. This condition is called Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) pattern. It's often discovered by chance during a heart test. When to see a doctor Many things can cause a fast heartbeat. It's important to get a prompt diagnosis and care. Sometimes a fast heartbeat isn't a concern. For example, the speed of the heartbeat may increase with exercise. If you feel like your heart is beating too fast, make an appointment to see a healthcare professional. Call 911 or your local emergency number if you have any of the following symptoms for more than a few minutes: Sensation of a fast or pounding heartbeat. Difficulty breathing. Chest pain. Request an appointment"
Prader-Willi syndrome,"Symptoms of Prader-Willi syndrome, which can vary, slowly change over time from childhood to adulthood. Infants Symptoms that may be present from birth include: Poor muscle tone. A main sign during infancy is poor muscle tone, also known as hypotonia. Babies may rest with their elbows and knees loosely extended instead of fixed. They also may feel floppy or like rag dolls when they're held. Distinct facial features. Babies may be born with almond-shaped eyes, a narrowing of the head at the temples, a turned-down mouth and a thin upper lip. Poor sucking reflex. Infants may have a poor sucking reflex because they have less muscle tone. Poor sucking makes feeding hard and can make it less likely they'll gain weight at the expected rate. Generally poor responsiveness. A baby may seem very tired, respond poorly to stimulation, have a hard time waking up or weakly cry. Underdeveloped genitals. Males may have a small penis and scrotum. The testicles may be small or not descend from the abdomen into the scrotum. This is known as cryptorchidism. In females, the clitoris and labia may be small. Early childhood to adulthood Other features of Prader-Willi syndrome appear when a child is very young and continue for life, including: Food craving and weight gain. A classic sign of Prader-Willi syndrome is a craving for food all the time, starting in early childhood. Being hungry all the time leads to eating often and eating large portions. This leads to quick weight gain. Unusual food-seeking behaviors, such as hoarding food, or eating frozen food or garbage, may occur. Underdeveloped sex organs. A condition called hypogonadism occurs when sex organs — testes in males and ovaries in females — produce little or no sex hormones. This leads to sex organs that don't develop fully and incomplete or delayed puberty. Nearly all people with Prader-Willi syndrome aren't able to get pregnant. Without treatment, females may not start their menstrual period until their 30s, or they may never have a period. Males may not have much facial hair, and their voices may never fully deepen. Poor growth and physical development. Not making enough growth hormone can shorten adult height and lead to low muscle mass and high body fat. Other endocrine problems may include not making enough thyroid hormone, also known as hypothyroidism. Another endocrine problem is central adrenal insufficiency, which keeps the body from responding properly to stress or infections. Having a hard time thinking, solving problems and learning. A common feature of Prader-Willi syndrome is having mild to moderate problems thinking, reasoning and problem-solving. This is called cognitive impairment. Even children and adults without cognitive impairment may have learning disabilities. Delayed motor skills. Toddlers with Prader-Willi syndrome often reach milestones in physical movement, such as sitting up or walking, later than other children. Speech problems. Speech often is delayed. Having a hard time choosing words and speaking clearly may continue as an adult. Behavioral problems. At times, children and adults may be very stubborn, angry, controlling or manipulative. They may throw temper tantrums, especially when denied food. They may not accept changes in routine. Also, they may start to show obsessive-compulsive or repetitive behaviors, or both. Other mental health conditions, such as anxiety and skin picking, may occur. Sleep conditions. Children and adults with Prader-Willi syndrome may have sleep conditions, including disruptions of the typical sleep cycle. They also may have sleep apnea, which is when breathing pauses during sleep. These conditions can make them very sleepy during the day and worsen behavior problems. Other symptoms. These symptoms may include small hands and feet, and curvature of the spine, also known as scoliosis. They also may have hip problems, less saliva flow, dental problems, and nearsightedness and other vision problems. Other symptoms include a lack of pigment, also known as hypopigmentation, which causes hair, eyes and skin to be pale. They also may have problems controlling their body temperature. They may be able to handle more pain than the average person. When to see a doctor Regularly scheduled well-baby visits can help find early signs of poor growth and development that can be signs of Prader-Willi syndrome or other conditions. If you have concerns about your baby's health between well-baby visits, schedule an appointment with your child's healthcare professional. Request an appointment"
Pouchitis,"Symptoms of pouchitis can include diarrhea, belly pain, joint pain, cramps and fever. Other symptoms include passing stool more often, stool leakage at night, trouble controlling stool passage and a strong urge to pass stool."
Post-vasectomy pain syndrome,"Having some discomfort after vasectomy is common, but men with PVPS have pain that never seems to get better after the procedure. Signs and symptoms of PVPS may include: Pain and tenderness in the scrotum Pressure or pain after ejaculation Dull ache in one or both testicles Pain and tenderness at the site of the vasectomy Swelling of the small, C-shaped tube behind the testicle where sperm are stored (epididymis) Pain with sex When to see a doctor See your health care provider immediately if you have pain or swelling in your testicles, discharge from your penis, or pain when you urinate. Your provider may be able to treat the cause with medicine or a minor procedure. If you have severe scrotal pain, seek emergency treatment. Request an appointment"
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),"Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms may start within the first three months after a traumatic event. But sometimes symptoms may not appear until years after the event. These symptoms last more than one month and cause major problems in social or work situations and how well you get along with others. They also can affect your ability to do your usual daily tasks. Generally, PTSD symptoms are grouped into four types: intrusive memories, avoidance, negative changes in thinking and mood, and changes in physical and emotional reactions. Symptoms can vary over time or vary from person to person. Intrusive memories Symptoms of intrusive memories may include: Unwanted, distressing memories of a traumatic event that come back over and over again. Reliving a traumatic event as if it were happening again, also known as flashbacks. Upsetting dreams or nightmares about a traumatic event. Severe emotional distress or physical reactions to something that reminds you of a traumatic event. Avoidance Symptoms of avoidance may include: Trying not to think or talk about a traumatic event. Staying away from places, activities or people that remind you of a traumatic event. Negative changes in thinking and mood Symptoms of negative changes in thinking and mood may include: Negative thoughts about yourself, other people or the world. Ongoing negative emotions of fear, blame, guilt, anger or shame. Memory problems, including not remembering important aspects of a traumatic event. Feeling detached from family and friends. Not being interested in activities you once enjoyed. Having a hard time feeling positive emotions. Feeling emotionally numb. Changes in physical and emotional reactions Symptoms of changes in physical and emotional reactions, also called arousal symptoms, may include: Being easily startled or frightened. Always being on guard for danger. Self-destructive behavior, such as drinking too much or driving too fast. Trouble sleeping. Trouble concentrating. Irritability, angry outbursts or aggressive behavior. Physical reactions, such as sweating, rapid breathing, fast heartbeat or shaking. For children 6 years old and younger, symptoms also may include: Reenacting a traumatic event or aspects of a traumatic event through play. Frightening dreams that may or may not include aspects of a traumatic event. Intensity of symptoms Over time, PTSD symptoms can vary in how severe they are. You may have more PTSD symptoms when you're generally stressed or when you come across reminders of what you went through, including the same time of year when a past traumatic event happened. For example, you may hear a car backfire and relive combat experiences. Or you may see a report on the news about a sexual assault and feel overcome by memories of your assault. When to see a doctor Talk to your healthcare professional or a mental health professional if you have disturbing thoughts and feelings about a traumatic event for more than a month, especially if they're severe. Also, see a health professional if you're having trouble getting your life back under control. Getting treatment as soon as possible can help prevent PTSD symptoms from getting worse.

Porphyria,"Symptoms can vary widely by type of porphyria and in how severe the symptoms are. Symptoms also can vary among people with the condition. Some people with a gene change that causes porphyria never have any symptoms. Acute porphyrias Acute porphyrias include forms of the disease that usually cause nervous system symptoms. A few forms also can affect the skin. Symptoms appear quickly and can be severe. Symptoms may last hours, days or weeks. The most common form of acute porphyria is called acute intermittent porphyria (AIP). AIP may last hours or days. Intermittent means that the symptoms may go away but return later. When the symptoms occur they are sometimes called attacks. Symptoms of acute porphyrias may include: Severe pain in the belly, chest, legs or back. Digestive problems, such as constipation, nausea and vomiting. Muscle pain, tingling, numbness, weakness or paralysis. Red or brown urine. Mental changes, such as anxiety, hallucinations or mental confusion. Rapid or irregular heartbeats you can feel, called palpitations. Breathing problems. High blood pressure. Seizures. Cutaneous porphyrias Cutaneous porphyrias include forms of the disease that cause skin symptoms as a result of sensitivity to sunlight. These forms usually don't affect the nervous system. Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is the most common type of all the porphyrias. Sun exposure may cause: Sensitivity to the sun and sometimes artificial light, causing burning pain in the skin. Sudden painful skin redness and swelling. Blisters on exposed skin, usually the hands, arms and face. Fragile thin skin with changes in skin color. Itching. Too much hair growth in affected areas. Red or brown urine. Erythropoietic protoporphyria (uh-rith-roe-poi-ET-ik pro-toe-por-FEAR-e-uh), also called EPP, is a rare type of cutaneous porphyria. It's the most common childhood porphyria. Sun or artificial light exposure quickly results in painful skin burning, irritation and swelling. Small bumps and blisters also appear. Repeated exposures can cause thick, leathery skin and scarring. When to see a doctor Many symptoms of porphyria are like those of other, more common conditions. This can make it difficult to know if you're having an attack of porphyria. If you have symptoms that could be porphyria, get medical attention. Prompt treatment is important. Request an appointment"

But serious forms of the condition may cause: Shortness of breath or not being able to breathe. Swelling in the ankles or feet. Pain in the stomach area. Feelings of tightness in the muscles of the uterus, called contractions. Your health care professional also may also suspect polyhydramnios if your uterus has become large for the number of weeks of pregnancy. Request an appointment"
Polycythemia vera,
Polio,"Nerve cell (neuron) Enlarge image Close Nerve cell (neuron) Nerve cell (neuron) The basic unit of communication in the nervous system is the nerve cell (neuron). Each nerve cell consists of the cell body, which includes the nucleus, a major branching fiber (axon) and numerous smaller branching fibers (dendrites). The myelin sheath is fatty material that covers, insulates and protects nerves of the brain and spinal cord. Most people infected with the virus that causes polio, called poliovirus, don't get symptoms. Abortive polio About 5% of people with the poliovirus get a mild version of the disease called abortive poliomyelitis. This leads to flu-like symptoms that last 2 to 3 days. These include: Fever Headache Muscle aches Sore throat Stomachache Loss of appetite Nausea Vomiting Nonparalytic polio A more severe form of the disease, called nonparalytic polio, affects about 1% of those infected. While the illness lasts longer than a few days, it doesn't cause paralysis. Besides having more-severe flu-like symptoms, nonparalytic polio symptoms may include: Neck pain or stiffness Aches or stiffness in the arms or legs Severe headache A second phase of symptoms may follow, or a person may seem to be getting better for a few days before a second phase starts. These symptoms include: Stiffness of the spine and neck Decreased reflexes Muscle weakness Paralytic polio This most serious form of the disease is rare. The disease begins much like nonparalytic polio. But it progresses to more-severe signs and symptoms, including: Intense pain Extreme sensitivity to touch Tingling or pricking sensations Muscles spasms or twitching Muscles weakness progressing to a limp paralysis Any combination of limbs may experience paralysis. But paralysis of one leg is most common, followed by paralysis of one arm. Depending on the severity of disease, other signs or symptoms may include: Paralysis of muscles involved in breathing Difficulty swallowing Post-polio syndrome Post-polio syndrome is the appearance of new signs or symptoms or the progression of problems. This usually happens decades after having polio. Common signs and symptoms include: Progressive muscle or joint weakness and pain Fatigue Muscle wasting Breathing or swallowing problems Sleep-related breathing disorders, such as sleep apnea Lowered tolerance of cold temperatures When to see a doctor Signs and symptoms of polio are similar to other viral diseases that affect the nervous system. It's important to get a timely and accurate diagnosis. If you had polio before, see your health care provider if you have new or worse signs or symptoms. Request an appointment"
Poison ivy rash,"Signs and symptoms of a poison ivy rash include: Redness Itching Swelling Blisters Difficulty breathing, if you've inhaled the smoke from burning poison ivy Poison ivy rash often appears in a straight line because of the way the plant brushes against your skin. But if you develop a rash after touching a piece of clothing or pet fur that has urushiol on it, the rash may be more spread out. You can also transfer the oil to other parts of your body with your fingers. The reaction usually develops 12 to 48 hours after exposure and lasts two to three weeks. The severity of the rash depends on the amount of urushiol that gets on your skin. When to see a doctor Seek emergency medical attention if: You inhaled the smoke from burning poison ivy and are having difficulty breathing See your doctor if: The reaction is severe or widespread Your skin continues to swell The rash affects your eyes, mouth or genitals Blisters are oozing pus You develop a fever greater than 100 F (37.8 C) The rash doesn't get better within a few weeks Request an appointment There is a problem with

Pneumonia,"The signs and symptoms of pneumonia vary from mild to severe, depending on factors such as the type of germ causing the infection, and your age and overall health. Mild signs and symptoms often are similar to those of a cold or flu, but they last longer. Signs and symptoms of pneumonia may include: Chest pain when you breathe or cough Confusion or changes in mental awareness (in adults age 65 and older) Cough, which may produce phlegm Fatigue Fever, sweating and shaking chills Lower than normal body temperature (in adults older than age 65 and people with weak immune systems) Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea Shortness of breath Newborns and infants may not show any sign of the infection. Or they may vomit, have a fever and cough, appear restless or tired and without energy, or have difficulty breathing and eating. When to see a doctor See your doctor if you have difficulty breathing, chest pain, persistent fever of 102 F (39 C) or higher, or persistent cough, especially if you're coughing up pus. It's especially important that people in these high-risk groups see a doctor: Adults older than age 65 Children younger than age 2 with signs and symptoms People with an underlying health condition or weakened immune system People receiving chemotherapy or taking medication that suppresses the immune system For some older adults and people with heart failure or chronic lung problems, pneumonia can quickly become a life-threatening condition.

Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS),"Symptoms of primary lateral sclerosis usually take years to develop and get worse. Symptoms generally begin in the legs. Rarely, PLS begins with weakness in the tongue or hands. Then weakness gradually moves down the spinal cord to the legs. However, symptoms vary from person to person. Symptoms may include: Stiffness, weakness and muscle spasms in the legs. This is known as spasticity. Rarely, spasticity starts in only one leg and moves to the arms, hands, tongue and jaw. Slowed movement. Tripping, being clumsy and having trouble with balance. Hand clumsiness. A hoarse voice, as well as slowed, slurred speech and drooling. Trouble chewing and swallowing. Sometimes, frequent, rapid and intense shifts in emotions. Rarely, breathing problems and bladder problems late in the disease. When to see a doctor Make an appointment to see a health care professional if you have persistent problems with stiffness or weakness in your legs or arms. Also see a health care professional if you have trouble swallowing or speaking. Take your child to a health care professional if your child develops muscle spasms or seems to be losing balance more often than usual. Request an appointment"
Pleurisy,"Signs and symptoms of pleurisy might include: Chest pain that worsens when you breathe, cough or sneeze. Shortness of breath — often from trying to limit breathing in and out. Cough — only in some cases. Fever — only in some cases. Pain caused by pleurisy might worsen with movement of your upper body and can spread to your shoulders or back. Pleurisy can occur along with pleural effusion, atelectasis or empyema: Pleural effusion. In some cases of pleurisy, fluid builds up in the small space between the two layers of tissue. This is called pleural effusion. When there is a fair amount of fluid, pleuritic pain lessens or disappears because the two layers of pleura are no longer in contact and don't rub together. Atelectasis. A large amount of fluid in the pleural space can create pressure. This can compress your lung to the point that it partially or completely collapses (atelectasis). This makes breathing difficult and might cause coughing. Empyema. The extra fluid in the pleural space can also become infected, resulting in a buildup of pus. This is called an empyema. Fever often occurs along with an empyema. When to see a doctor Call your healthcare provider or seek emergency care right away if you experience unexplained, intense chest pain during breathing. You might have a problem with your lungs, heart or pleura or an underlying illness for which you need prompt medical care. There is a problem with

Plague,"There are three types of plague. The symptoms vary for each type. Bubonic plague Bubonic plague causes swelling of lymph nodes. These are small, bean-shaped filters in the body's immune system. A swollen lymph node is called a bubo. The word ""bubonic"" is describing this feature of the disease. If a person has bubonic plague, buboes appear in the armpits, groin or neck. Buboes are tender or painful. They vary in size from about less than half an inch (1 centimeter) to about 4 inches (10 centimeters). Other symptoms of bubonic plague may include: Sudden high fever and chills. Headache. Tiredness. Not feeling well in general. Weakness. Muscle aches. Rarely, skin sores. Septicemic plague Septicemic plague occurs when plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream. Buboes may not be present. Early symptoms are very general and include: Sudden high fever and chills. Extreme weakness. Stomach pain, diarrhea and vomiting. More-serious symptoms may develop with advanced disease and organ failure. These include: Bleeding from the mouth, nose or rectum, or under the skin. Signs of shock, such as seizure, rash and low blood pressure. Blackening and death of tissue, called gangrene, most commonly on the fingers, toes, ears and nose. Pneumonic plague Pneumonic plague affects the lungs. The disease may begin in the lungs, or it may spread from infected lymph nodes to the lungs. Symptoms can begin within a few hours after exposure and worsen rapidly. Symptoms may include: Sudden high fever and chills. Cough, with bloody mucus. Difficulty or irregular breathing. Chest pain. Upset stomach and vomiting. Headache. Weakness. If treatment is not begun the first day, the disease progresses rapidly to failure of the lungs, shock and death. When to see a doctor Get immediate care if you have a sudden high fever. Get emergency care if you have a sudden high fever or other symptoms and you live in an area that has had cases of plague. In the western United States, most cases have been in Arizona, California, Colorado and New Mexico. Cases have occurred in Africa, Asia and Latin America. The countries with frequent cases include Madagascar, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Peru. Request an appointment"

Tinea versicolor,
Pityriasis rosea,
Pituitary tumors,"Not all pituitary tumors cause symptoms. Sometimes these tumors are found during an imaging test, such as an MRI or a CT scan, that is done for another reason. If they don't cause symptoms, pituitary tumors usually don't need treatment. Pituitary tumor symptoms may be caused by a tumor putting pressure on the brain or on other parts of the body nearby. Symptoms also can be caused by a hormone imbalance. Hormone levels can rise when a pituitary tumor makes too much of one or more hormones. Or a large tumor that disrupts the way the pituitary gland works may cause hormone levels to fall. Symptoms from tumor pressure Macroadenomas can put pressure on the pituitary gland, on nerves, on the brain and on other parts of the body nearby. That can cause symptoms such as: Headache. Eye problems due to pressure on the optic nerve, especially loss of side vision, also called peripheral vision, and double vision. Pain in the face, sometimes including sinus pain or ear pain. Drooping eyelid. Seizures. Nausea and vomiting. Symptoms from hormone changes Cushing syndrome Enlarge image Close Cushing syndrome Cushing syndrome Without treatment, Cushing syndrome can cause facial roundness, weight gain around the middle body and upper back, thinning of the arms and legs, easy bruising, and stretch marks. Person with acromegaly Enlarge image Close Person with acromegaly Person with acromegaly Symptoms of acromegaly include an enlarged face and hands. Changes to the face may cause the brow bone and lower jaw to jut out, and the nose and lips to get larger. Low amounts of hormones Macroadenomas can limit the pituitary gland's ability to make hormones. When that happens, symptoms may include: Tiredness or weakness. Lack of energy. Sexual problems, such as problems with erections and less interest in sex. Changes in menstrual cycles. Nausea. Feeling cold. Losing or gaining weight without trying. High amounts of hormones Functioning pituitary adenomas typically make a large amount of one hormone. That exposes the body to high levels of that hormone. Rarely, a pituitary adenoma may make more than one hormone. The following types of functioning pituitary adenomas cause different symptoms depending on the hormones they make. Pituitary tumors that make adrenocorticotropic hormone Pituitary tumors that make adrenocorticotropic hormone are called corticotroph adenomas. Adrenocorticotropic hormone, also called ACTH , causes the adrenal glands to make the hormone cortisol. ACTH tumors trigger the adrenal glands to make too much cortisol. This causes a condition called Cushing disease. Cushing disease is one cause of Cushing syndrome. Cushing disease symptoms include: Weight gain and fatty tissue deposits around the midsection and upper back. Rounded face. Stretch marks. Thin skin that bruises easily. Thinning of the arms and legs with muscle weakness. Thicker or more visible body hair. Slow healing of cuts, insect bites and infections. Areas of darkened skin. Acne. Changes in menstrual cycles. Sexual problems, including problems with erections and less interest in sex. Pituitary tumors that make growth hormone Pituitary tumors that make growth hormone also are called growth hormone-secreting tumors or somatotroph adenomas. Too much growth hormone leads to a condition known as acromegaly. Acromegaly can cause: Changes in facial features, including larger lips, nose and tongue; longer lower jaw; and wide spaces between teeth. Growth of hands and feet. Thicker skin. More sweating and body odor. Joint pain. A deeper voice. Children and teens who have too much growth hormone might also grow faster or taller than usual. This condition is called gigantism. Pituitary tumors that make luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) are also known as gonadotropins. Pituitary tumors that make these hormones are called gonadotroph adenomas. It's uncommon for these adenomas to make too many hormones that then trigger symptoms. Instead, symptoms from these adenomas usually are due to tumor pressure. If symptoms do happen because of too much LH and FSH , they affect women and men differently. Symptoms in women may include: Change in menstrual cycles. Fertility problems. Enlargement of and pain in the ovaries caused by a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Symptoms in men may include: Enlarged testicles. Higher levels of testosterone. Pituitary tumors that make prolactin These adenomas are called prolactinomas. Too much of the hormone prolactin can lead to a decrease in the body's levels of sex hormones — estrogen and testosterone. Too much prolactin affects men and women differently. In women, too much prolactin might cause: Irregular menstrual cycles. Lack of menstrual cycles. Milky discharge from the breasts. Breast tenderness. Problems with fertility. Less interest in sex. In men, too much prolactin can cause a condition called male hypogonadism. Symptoms might include: Problems with erections. Less interest in sex. Breast growth. Problems with fertility. Less body and facial hair. Pituitary tumors that make thyroid-stimulating hormone Pituitary tumors that make thyroid-stimulating hormone are called thyrotroph adenomas. They also may be referred to as thyroid-stimulating hormone-secreting tumors. They cause the thyroid gland to make too much of the hormone thyroxine, also called T-4. That leads to a condition called hyperthyroidism, also known as overactive thyroid disease. Hyperthyroidism can speed up the body's metabolism causing many symptoms. Some of the most common include: Weight loss. Rapid or irregular heartbeat. Nervousness, anxiety or irritability. Frequent bowel movements. Sweating. Tremor. Sleep problems. When to see a doctor If you develop symptoms that might be associated with a pituitary tumor, see your health care provider. Treatment for pituitary tumors often can bring hormones back to a healthy level and ease symptoms. Although rare, some pituitary tumors are hereditary. That means they run in families. In particular, the hereditary disorder multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1) can cause pituitary tumors. If MEN 1 runs in your family, talk to your health care provider about tests that may help find a pituitary tumor early. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Thrombophlebitis,
Pheochromocytoma,"A pheochromocytoma often causes the following symptoms: High blood pressure. Headache. Heavy sweating. Rapid heartbeat. Some people with pheochromocytomas also have symptoms such as: Nervous shaking. Skin that turns a lighter color, also called pallor. Shortness of breath. Panic attack-type symptoms, which can include sudden intense fear. Anxiety or a sense of doom. Vision problems. Constipation. Weight loss. Some people with pheochromocytomas have no symptoms. They don't realize they have the tumor until an imaging test happens to find it. Symptom spells Most often, the symptoms of pheochromocytoma come and go. When they start suddenly and keep coming back, they're known as spells or attacks. These spells may or may not have a trigger that can be found. Certain activities or conditions can lead to a spell, such as: Physical hard work. Anxiety or stress. Changes in body position, such as bending over, or going from sitting or lying down to standing. Labor and delivery. Surgery and a medicine that causes you to be in a sleep-like state during surgery, called an anesthetic. Foods high in tyramine, a substance that affects blood pressure, also can trigger spells. Tyramine is common in foods that are fermented, aged, pickled, cured, overripe or spoiled. These foods include: Some cheeses. Some beers and wines. Soybeans or products made with soy. Chocolate. Dried or smoked meats. Certain medicines and drugs that can trigger spells include: Depression medicines called tricyclic antidepressants. Some examples of tricyclic antidepressants are amitriptyline and desipramine (Norpramin). Depression medicines called monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), such as phenelzine (Nardil), tranylcypromine (Parnate) and isocarboxazid (Marplan). The risk of spells is even higher if these medicines are taken with foods or drinks high in tyramine. Stimulants such as caffeine, amphetamines or cocaine. When to see a doctor High blood pressure is one of the main symptoms of a pheochromocytoma. But most people who have high blood pressure don't have an adrenal tumor. Talk to your healthcare professional if any of these factors apply to you: Spells of symptoms linked with pheochromocytoma, such as headaches, sweating and a fast, pounding heartbeat. Trouble controlling high blood pressure with your current treatment. High blood pressure that starts before the age of 20. Recurring large rises in blood pressure. A family history of pheochromocytoma. A family history of a related genetic condition. These include multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 2 (MEN 2), von Hippel-Lindau disease, inherited paraganglioma syndromes and neurofibromatosis 1. Request an appointment"
Phenylketonuria (PKU),"Newborns with PKU initially don't have any symptoms. However, without treatment, babies usually develop signs of PKU within a few months. Signs and symptoms of untreated PKU can be mild or severe and may include: A musty odor in the breath, skin or urine, caused by too much phenylalanine in the body Nervous system (neurological) problems that may include seizures Skin rashes, such as eczema Lighter skin, hair and eye color than family members, because phenylalanine can't transform into melanin — the pigment responsible for hair and skin tone Unusually small head size (microcephaly) Hyperactivity Intellectual disability Delayed development Behavioral, emotional and social problems Mental health disorders Severity varies The severity of PKU depends on the type. Classic PKU . The most severe form of the disorder is called classic PKU . The enzyme needed to break down phenylalanine is missing or severely reduced. This results in high levels of phenylalanine that can cause severe brain damage. Less severe forms of PKU . In mild or moderate forms, the enzyme still has some function, so phenylalanine levels are not as high, resulting in a smaller risk of significant brain damage. Regardless of the form, most infants, children and adults with the disorder still require a special PKU diet to prevent intellectual disability and other complications. Pregnancy and PKU Women who have PKU and become pregnant are at risk of another form of the condition called maternal PKU . If women don't follow the special PKU diet before and during pregnancy, blood phenylalanine levels can become high and harm the developing baby. Even women with less severe forms of PKU may place their unborn children at risk by not following the PKU diet. Babies born to women with high phenylalanine levels don't often inherit PKU . But a child can have serious problems if the level of phenylalanine is high in the mother's blood during pregnancy. At birth, the baby may have: Low birth weight Unusually small head Problems with the heart In addition, maternal PKU can cause the child to have delayed development, intellectual disability and problems with behavior. When to see a doctor Talk to your health care provider in these situations: Newborns. If routine newborn screening tests show that your baby may have PKU , your child's health care provider will want to start dietary treatment right away to prevent long-term problems. Women of childbearing years. It's especially important for women with a history of PKU to see a health care provider and maintain the PKU diet before becoming pregnant and during pregnancy. This reduces the risk of high blood phenylalanine levels harming their unborn babies. Adults. People with PKU need to receive lifelong care. Adults with PKU who have stopped the PKU diet in their teens may benefit from a visit with their health care providers. Returning to the diet may improve mental functioning and behavior and prevent further damage to the central nervous system that can result from high phenylalanine levels.

Schizotypal personality disorder,"Schizotypal personality disorder usually includes five or more of these symptoms. The person may: Be a loner and lack close friends and other relationships outside of the immediate family. Have flat emotions or have emotional responses that are limited or not proper socially. Have too much social anxiety, which is ongoing. Incorrectly interpret events, such as feeling that something harmless or not offensive has a direct personal meaning. Have strange or unusual thinking, beliefs or mannerisms. Have suspicious or paranoid thoughts and constant doubts about the loyalty of others. Believe in special powers, such as mental telepathy or superstitions. Have unusual thoughts, such as sensing an absent person's presence, or having illusions. Dress in odd ways, such as appearing messy or wearing oddly matched clothes. Speak in an odd way, such as vague or unusual patterns of speaking, or ramble oddly while speaking. Symptoms of schizotypal personality disorder, such as more interest in activities done alone or a high level of social anxiety, may be seen in the teen years. The child may not do well in school or appear socially out of step with peers. This may lead to teasing or bullying. Schizotypal personality disorder vs. schizophrenia It's easy to confuse schizotypal personality disorder with schizophrenia, which is a severe mental health condition where people struggle with interpreting and managing reality. This is known as psychosis. People with schizotypal personality disorder may have brief psychotic bouts with delusions or hallucinations. But the bouts aren't as often, as long or as intense as with schizophrenia. Another key difference is that people with schizotypal personality disorder usually can be made aware of how their distorted ideas differ from reality. Those with schizophrenia generally can't be swayed away from their delusions. Despite the differences, people with schizotypal personality disorder can benefit from treatments like those used for schizophrenia. Sometimes schizotypal personality disorder is thought to be on a spectrum with schizophrenia, with schizotypal personality disorder viewed as less severe. When to see a doctor People with schizotypal personality disorder are likely to seek help only at the urging of friends or family members. Or people with schizotypal personality disorder may seek help for another problem such as depression, anxiety or substance misuse. If you think that a friend or family member may have the condition, consider gently suggesting that the person seek the help of a healthcare professional or mental health professional. If you need immediate help If you're concerned that you might harm yourself or someone else, go to an emergency department or call 911 in the U.S. or your local emergency number right away. Or contact a suicide hotline. In the U.S., call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline , available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Or use the Lifeline Chat . Services are free and confidential. The Suicide & Crisis Lifeline in the U.S. has a Spanish language phone line at 1-888-628-9454 (toll-free). Request an appointment"
Schizoid personality disorder,"If you have schizoid personality disorder, it's likely that you: Want to be alone and do activities alone. Do not want or enjoy close relationships. Feel little if any desire for sexual relationships. Take pleasure in few activities, if any. Find it hard to express your emotions and react. May lack humor or not be interested in others. Or you may be cold toward others. May lack the drive that makes you want to reach goals. Do not react to praise or criticism from others. People may view you as odd or unusual. Schizoid personality disorder most often begins when a person is a young adult. But some symptoms might be noticed during childhood. These symptoms may make it hard to do well in school, at work, in social situations or in other areas of life. But the person may do well if the job can be done by mostly working alone. Schizoid personality disorder and schizophrenia Although the names may sound alike, schizoid personality disorder, schizotypal personality disorder and schizophrenia spectrum disorders are all different types of mental health conditions. But they can have similar symptoms, such as not being able to make social connections or show a full range of emotions. In contrast to schizotypal personality disorder and schizophrenia, people with schizoid personality disorder: Are in touch with reality. Are not likely to feel paranoid, hold bizarre beliefs or hallucinate. Make sense when speaking. Although the tone may not be lively, the content of the person's speech is not strange or hard to follow. When to see a doctor People with schizoid personality disorder typically only seek treatment for a related problem, such as depression. If someone close to you has urged you to seek help for symptoms common to schizoid personality disorder, make an appointment with a doctor or another health care professional, or a mental health professional. If you suspect a loved one may have schizoid personality disorder, gently suggest that the person seek help. You can offer to go along to the first appointment. Request an appointment"
Persistent post-concussive symptoms (Post-concussion syndrome),"Persistent post-concussive symptoms can be different in each person. They may include: Headaches. Dizziness. Fatigue. Irritability. Anxiety. Depression. Trouble falling asleep or sleeping too much. Poor concentration and memory. Ringing in the ears. Blurry vision. Noise and light sensitivity. Nausea or vomiting. Neck pain. Headaches after a concussion most often feel like migraines. The headaches also might feel like tension-type headaches, which may be related to a neck injury that happened at the same time as the head injury. When to see a doctor See a healthcare professional if you experience a head injury that causes confusion, memory loss, vision changes, nausea, vomiting or a sudden, bad headache. Get medical help even if you never lost consciousness. Also see a healthcare professional if you lose feeling, can't move a part of your body, or have trouble speaking or writing. If you get a concussion while playing a sport, don't go back into the game. Seek medical help so that the injury doesn't get worse. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Peripheral nerve tumors,"The symptoms of a peripheral nerve tumor develop from direct effects on the main nerve or from the tumor pressing on nearby nerves, blood vessels or tissues. As the tumor grows, it may be more likely to cause symptoms, although tumor size doesn't always determine effects. Symptoms of peripheral nerve tumors vary depending on where the tumors are located and the tissues affected. They include: Swelling or a lump under the skin. Pain, tingling or numbness. Weakness or a loss of function in the affected area. Dizziness or a loss of balance. When to see a doctor See your health care provider if you have any of the symptoms listed, especially if you have a lump that grows quickly. Request an appointment"
Peripheral nerve injuries,"With a peripheral nerve injury, symptoms may range from mild to serious, limiting your daily activities. Your symptoms often depend on which nerve fibers are damaged: Motor nerves. These nerves regulate all the muscles under your conscious control, such as those used for walking, talking and holding objects. Damage to these nerves can cause muscle weakness, painful cramps and muscle twitching. Sensory nerves. Because these nerves relay information about touch, temperature and pain, you may experience a variety of symptoms. These include numbness or tingling in the hands or feet. You may have trouble walking, keeping your balance with your eyes closed, fastening buttons, or sensing pain or changes in temperature. Injury of sensory nerves also may cause pain. Autonomic (aw-tuh-NOM-ik) nerves. This group of nerves regulates activities that are not controlled consciously, such as breathing, heart and thyroid function, and digestion. Symptoms may include excessive sweating, changes in blood pressure, the inability to tolerate heat and gastrointestinal symptoms. Many peripheral nerve injuries affect more than one type of nerve fiber, so you may experience a range of symptoms. When to see a doctor If you experience weakness, tingling, numbness or a total loss of feeling, see your healthcare professional to find out the cause. It's important to treat peripheral nerve injuries early. Request an appointment"
Perimenopause,"Throughout the menopausal transition, some subtle — and some not-so-subtle — changes in your body may take place. You might experience: Irregular periods. As ovulation becomes more unpredictable, the length of time between periods may be longer or shorter, your flow may be light to heavy, and you may skip some periods. If you have a persistent change of seven days or more in the length of your menstrual cycle, you may be in early perimenopause. If you have a space of 60 days or more between periods, you're likely in late perimenopause. Hot flashes and sleep problems. Hot flashes are common during perimenopause. The intensity, length and frequency vary. Sleep problems are often due to hot flashes or night sweats, but sometimes sleep becomes unpredictable even without them. Mood changes. Mood swings, irritability or increased risk of depression may happen during perimenopause. The cause of these symptoms may be sleep disruption associated with hot flashes. Mood changes may also be caused by factors not related to the hormonal changes of perimenopause. Vaginal and bladder problems. When estrogen levels diminish, your vaginal tissues may lose lubrication and elasticity, making intercourse painful. Low estrogen may also leave you more vulnerable to urinary or vaginal infections. Loss of tissue tone may contribute to urinary incontinence. Decreasing fertility. As ovulation becomes irregular, your ability to conceive decreases. However, as long as you're having periods, pregnancy is still possible. If you wish to avoid pregnancy, use birth control until you've had no periods for 12 months. Changes in sexual function. During perimenopause, sexual arousal and desire may change. But if you had satisfactory sexual intimacy before menopause, this will likely continue through perimenopause and beyond. Loss of bone. With declining estrogen levels, you start to lose bone more quickly than you replace it, increasing your risk of osteoporosis — a disease that causes fragile bones. Changing cholesterol levels. Declining estrogen levels may lead to unfavorable changes in your blood cholesterol levels, including an increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol — the ""bad"" cholesterol — which contributes to an increased risk of heart disease. At the same time, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol — the ""good"" cholesterol — decreases in many women as they age, which also increases the risk of heart disease. When to see a doctor Some women seek medical attention for their perimenopausal symptoms. But others either tolerate the changes or simply don't experience symptoms severe enough to need attention. Because symptoms may be subtle and come on gradually, you may not realize at first that they're all connected to the same thing — hormone fluctuations of the menopausal transition. If you have symptoms that interfere with your life or well-being, such as hot flashes, mood swings or changes in sexual function that concern you, see your doctor.

Pemphigus,"Pemphigus causes blisters on the skin and mucous membranes. The blisters break easily, leaving open sores. The sores may become infected and ooze. The symptoms of two common types of pemphigus are as follows: Pemphigus vulgaris. This type usually begins with blisters in the mouth and then on the skin or genital mucous membranes. They're often painful but don't itch. Blisters in the mouth or throat may make it hard to talk, drink and eat. Pemphigus foliaceus. This type causes blisters on the chest, back and shoulders. The blisters may be itchy or painful. Pemphigus foliaceus doesn't cause mouth blisters.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID),
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS),"Symptoms of PCOS often start around the time of the first menstrual period. Sometimes symptoms develop later after you have had periods for a while. The symptoms of PCOS vary. A diagnosis of PCOS is made when you have at least two of these: Irregular periods. Having few menstrual periods or having periods that aren't regular are common signs of PCOS . So is having periods that last for many days or longer than is typical for a period. For example, you might have fewer than nine periods a year. And those periods may occur more than 35 days apart. You may have trouble getting pregnant. Too much androgen. High levels of the hormone androgen may result in excess facial and body hair. This is called hirsutism. Sometimes, severe acne and male-pattern baldness can happen, too. Polycystic ovaries. Your ovaries might be bigger. Many follicles containing immature eggs may develop around the edge of the ovary. The ovaries might not work the way they should. PCOS signs and symptoms are typically more severe in people with obesity. When to see a doctor See your health care provider if you're worried about your periods, if you're having trouble getting pregnant, or if you have signs of excess androgen. These might include new hair growth on your face and body, acne and male-pattern baldness. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Pseudobulbar affect,"The primary sign of pseudobulbar affect (PBA) is frequent, involuntary and uncontrollable outbursts of crying or laughing that are exaggerated or not connected to your emotional state. Laughter often turns to tears. Your mood will appear normal between episodes, which can occur at any time. Crying appears to be a more common sign of PBA than laughing. The degree of the emotional response caused by PBA is often striking, with crying or laughing lasting up to several minutes. For example, you might laugh uncontrollably in response to a mildly amusing comment. Or you might laugh or cry in situations that others don't see as funny or sad. These emotional responses typically represent a change from how you would have previously responded. Because pseudobulbar affect often involves crying, the condition is frequently mistaken for depression. However, PBA episodes tend to be short in duration, while depression causes a persistent feeling of sadness. Also, people with PBA often lack certain features of depression, such as sleep disturbances or a loss of appetite. But depression is common among those who have pseudobulbar affect.

Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome,
Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD),"Sometimes it's difficult to recognize the difference between a strong-willed or emotional child and one with oppositional defiant disorder. It's common for children to show oppositional behavior at certain stages of development. Symptoms of ODD generally begin during preschool years. Sometimes ODD may develop later, but almost always before the early teen years. Oppositional and defiant behaviors are frequent and ongoing. They cause severe problems with relationships, social activities, school and work, for both the child and the family. Emotional and behavioral symptoms of ODD generally last at least six months. They include angry and irritable mood, argumentative and defiant behavior, and hurtful and revengeful behavior. Angry and irritable mood Often and easily loses temper. Is frequently touchy and easily annoyed by others. Is often angry and resentful. Argumentative and defiant behavior Often argues with adults or people in authority. Often actively defies or refuses to follow adults' requests or rules. Often annoys or upsets people on purpose. Often blames others for their own mistakes or misbehavior. Hurtful and revengeful behavior Says mean and hateful things when upset. Tries to hurt the feelings of others and seeks revenge, also called being vindictive. Has shown vindictive behavior at least twice in the past six months. Severity ODD can be mild, moderate or severe: Mild. Symptoms occur only in one setting, such as only at home, school, work or with peers. Moderate. Some symptoms occur in at least two settings. Severe. Some symptoms occur in three or more settings. For some children, symptoms may first be seen only at home. But with time, problem behavior also may happen in other settings, such as school, social activities and with friends. When to see a doctor Your child isn't likely to see their own behavior as a problem. Instead, your child will probably complain about unreasonable demands or blame others for problems. If you think your child may have ODD or other problem behavior, or you're concerned about your ability to parent a challenging child, seek help from a child psychologist or a child psychiatrist with expertise in behavior problems. Ask your child's pediatrician or other health care provider for a referral to a mental health provider. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD),"Obsessive-compulsive disorder usually includes both obsessions and compulsions. But it's also possible to have only obsession symptoms or only compulsion symptoms. You may or may not know that your obsessions and compulsions are beyond reason. But they take up a great deal of time, reduce your quality of life, and get in the way of your daily routines and responsibilities. Obsession symptoms OCD obsessions are lasting and unwanted thoughts that keeping coming back or urges or images that are intrusive and cause distress or anxiety. You might try to ignore them or get rid of them by acting based on ritual. These obsessions usually intrude when you're trying to think of or do other things. Obsessions often have themes, such as: Fear of contamination or dirt. Doubting and having a hard time dealing with uncertainty. Needing things to be orderly and balanced. Aggressive or horrific thoughts about losing control and harming yourself or others. Unwanted thoughts, including aggression, or sexual or religious subjects. Examples of obsession symptoms include: Fear of being contaminated by touching objects others have touched. Doubts that you've locked the door or turned off the stove. Intense stress when objects aren't orderly or facing a certain way. Images of driving your car into a crowd of people. Thoughts about shouting obscenities or not acting the right way in public. Unpleasant sexual images. Staying away from situations that can cause obsessions, such as shaking hands. Compulsion symptoms OCD compulsions are repetitive behaviors that you feel driven to do. These repetitive behaviors or mental acts are meant to reduce anxiety related to your obsessions or prevent something bad from happening. But taking part in the compulsions brings no pleasure and may offer only limited relief from anxiety. You may make up rules or rituals to follow that help control your anxiety when you're having obsessive thoughts. These compulsions are beyond reason and often don't relate to the issue they're intended to fix. As with obsessions, compulsions usually have themes, such as: Washing and cleaning. Checking. Counting. Ordering. Following a strict routine. Demanding reassurance. Examples of compulsion symptoms include: Hand-washing until your skin becomes raw. Checking doors over and over again to make sure they're locked. Checking the stove over and over again to make sure it's off. Counting in certain patterns. Silently repeating a prayer, word or phrase. Trying to replace a bad thought with a good thought. Arranging your canned goods to face the same way. Severity varies OCD usually begins in the teen or young adult years, but it can start in childhood. Symptoms usually begin over time and tend to vary in how serious they are throughout life. The types of obsessions and compulsions you have also can change over time. Symptoms generally get worse when you are under greater stress, including times of transition and change. OCD , usually thought to be a lifelong disorder, can have mild to moderate symptoms or be so severe and time-consuming that it becomes disabling. When to see a doctor There's a difference between being a perfectionist — someone who needs flawless results or performance — and having OCD . OCD thoughts aren't simply excessive worries about real issues in your life or liking to have things clean or arranged in a specific way. If your obsessions and compulsions affect your quality of life, see your doctor or mental health professional. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Obesity,"Body mass index, known as BMI, is often used to diagnose obesity. To calculate BMI , multiply weight in pounds by 703, divide by height in inches and then divide again by height in inches. Or divide weight in kilograms by height in meters squared. There are several online calculators available that help calculate BMI . See BMI calculator BMI Weight status Below 18.5 Underweight 18.5-24.9 Healthy 25.0-29.9 Overweight 30.0 and higher Obesity Asians with a BMI of 23 or higher may have an increased risk of health problems. For most people, BMI provides a reasonable estimate of body fat. However, BMI doesn't directly measure body fat. Some people, such as muscular athletes, may have a BMI in the obesity category even though they don't have excess body fat. Many health care professionals also measure around a person's waist to help guide treatment decisions. This measurement is called a waist circumference. Weight-related health problems are more common in men with a waist circumference over 40 inches (102 centimeters). They're more common in women with a waist measurement over 35 inches (89 centimeters). Body fat percentage is another measurement that may be used during a weight loss program to track progress. When to see a doctor If you're concerned about your weight or weight-related health problems, ask your health care professional about obesity management.

Overactive bladder,"If you have an overactive bladder, you may: Feel a sudden urge to urinate that's hard to control. Lose urine without meaning to after an urgent need to urinate, called urgency incontinence. Urinate often. This can mean eight or more times in 24 hours. Wake up more than twice a night to urinate, called nocturia. Even if you can get to the toilet in time when you feel an urge to urinate, having to urinate often during day and night can disrupt your life. When to see a doctor Although common among older adults, overactive bladder isn't a typical part of aging. It might not be easy to talk about your symptoms.

Noonan syndrome,"Symptoms of Noonan syndrome vary greatly and range from mild to severe. These symptoms may be related to the specific gene containing the change. Facial features How the face looks is one key feature that leads to a diagnosis of Noonan syndrome. Facial features may be easier to see in infants and young children but change with age. These distinct features become less clear in adults. Noonan syndrome may include these features: Eyes are wide-set, slant down and have droopy lids. Eyes may be pale blue or green. Ears are set low and look like they're tipped backward. Nose is depressed at the top, with a wide base and round tip. Mouth has a deep groove between the nose and the mouth and wide peaks in the upper lip. The crease that runs from the edge of the nose to the corner of the mouth becomes deeply grooved with age. Teeth may be crooked. The inside roof of the mouth may be highly arched. And the lower jaw may be small. Facial features may appear coarse but look sharper with age. The face may appear droopy and not show expression. Head may be large with a big forehead and a low hairline on the back of the head. Skin may appear thin and transparent with age. Heart disease Many people with Noonan syndrome are born with a heart problem that causes some of the key symptoms of the condition. This is called congenital heart disease. Also, some heart problems can occur later in life. Some forms of congenital heart disease related to Noonan syndrome include: Valve conditions. Pulmonary valve stenosis is a narrowing of the pulmonary valve. This valve is the flap of tissue that separates the lower right chamber of the heart — called the right ventricle — from the artery that supplies blood to the lungs — called the pulmonary artery. Pulmonary valve stenosis is the most common heart problem seen with Noonan syndrome. It may occur with or without other heart problems. Thickening of the heart muscle. Unusual growth or thickening of the heart muscle — also known as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy — affects some people with Noonan syndrome. Other heart problems. Problems with heart structure can involve a hole in the wall that separates the two lower chambers of the heart, known as ventricles. This is called a ventricular septal defect. Another defect sometimes seen is narrowing of the artery that carries blood to the lungs for oxygen. This is called pulmonary artery stenosis. Or there can be narrowing of the major blood vessel known as the aorta, which carries blood from the heart to the body. This is called aortic coarctation. Irregular heart rhythm. This can occur with or without other problems in heart structure. Most people with Noonan syndrome have a heart rhythm that is not regular. Growth issues Noonan syndrome can affect typical growth. Many children with Noonan syndrome do not grow at a typical rate. Issues may include: Typical birth weight but slower growth over time. Eating difficulties that may lead to poor nutrition and weight gain. Growth hormone levels that may be too low. Delay in the growth spurt that's typically seen during the teenage years because bones do not reach maximum strength or density until later. Short height as an adult, which is common, but some people with Noonan syndrome may not be short. Issues with muscles and bones Some common issues can include: A condition called pectus excavatum, where the breastbone and ribs sink too far into the chest. It also is possible to have pectus carinatum, where the breastbone and ribs grow outward, making the chest stick out more than usual. Nipples that are wide apart. Short neck, often with extra folds of skin, called a webbed neck. A spine that has an unusual curve. Learning disabilities Noonan syndrome does not affect the intelligence of most people who have the condition. But they may have: A higher risk of learning disabilities and mild intellectual disability. A wide range of mental, emotional and behavioral issues that are usually mild. Hearing and vision problems that may make it harder to learn. Eye conditions Common signs of Noonan syndrome are eyes and eyelids that are unusual, including: Problems with the eye muscles, such as cross-eye, also known as strabismus. Refractive problems, which means the cornea or the lens is egg-shaped with two curves that do not match. This can make vision blurry or distorted, or make it hard to see things close up or far away. Rapid movement of the eyeballs, also known as nystagmus. Cataracts, which make an eye cloudy. Hearing problems Noonan syndrome can cause hearing problems due to nerve issues or an inner ear bone structure that is not typical. Bleeding problems Noonan syndrome can cause bleeding problems and easy bruising. That's because the blood of some people with Noonan syndrome may not clot properly and may have low levels of proteins that are needed for clots to form. So they bleed longer than usual. Lymphatic conditions Noonan syndrome can cause problems with the lymphatic system, which drains excess fluid from the body and helps fight infection. These problems: May show up before or after birth or start in the teenage years or as an adult. Some children are born with swelling of the hands, feet and tissue of the neck. Can focus on a particular area of the body or be widespread. Most commonly cause too much fluid to build up in the back of the hands or top of the feet. This fluid buildup is called lymphedema. Genital and kidney conditions Many people with Noonan syndrome have problems with their genitals and kidneys: Testicles. It's common for males with Noonan syndrome to have undescended testicles. These are testicles that have not moved into proper position in the bag of skin hanging below the penis, called the scrotum. Puberty. Puberty may be delayed in males and females. Fertility. For most females, Noonan syndrome does not affect their ability to get pregnant. But fertility in males may not develop as expected, often because of undescended testicles. Kidneys. Kidney problems generally are mild and not common. Skin conditions People with Noonan syndrome may have skin conditions. They may have various problems that affect the color and texture of the skin. They also may have coarse or sparse hair. When to see a doctor Sometimes the symptoms of Noonan syndrome can be hard to see. If you suspect you or your child may have this condition, see your primary care professional or your child's pediatrician. You may be referred to a specialist in genetics or a specialist in heart problems or another type of doctor, depending on the symptoms. If your unborn child is at risk because of a family history of Noonan syndrome, tests may be able to be done before birth. Request an appointment"
Nonallergic rhinitis,
Nonmelanoma skin cancer,"Symptoms of nonmelanoma skin cancer often develop on parts of the body that are exposed to the sun. Examples include the scalp, face, ears, neck, chest, arms and hands. But nonmelanoma skin cancer can happen on other parts of the body too. This includes the lips, fingers, fingernails and genital areas. Nonmelanoma skin cancer symptoms appear as a change in the skin, including: A new growth on the skin. Changes to an existing skin spot, such as changes in shape or color. Itching, pain, crusting or bleeding of a skin spot. A sore that won't heal or one that keeps coming back. When to see a doctor Make an appointment with a healthcare professional if you see any changes on your skin that worry you. Request an appointment"
Nightmare disorder,"You're more likely to have a nightmare in the second half of your night. Nightmares may occur rarely or more frequently, even several times a night. Episodes are generally brief, but they cause you to awaken, and returning to sleep can be difficult. A nightmare may involve these features: Your dream seems vivid and real and is very upsetting, often becoming more disturbing as the dream unfolds. Your dream storyline is usually related to threats to safety or survival, but it can have other disturbing themes. Your dream awakens you. You feel scared, anxious, angry, sad or disgusted as a result of your dream. You feel sweaty or have a pounding heartbeat while in bed.

Sleep terrors (night terrors),"Sleep terrors differ from nightmares. A nightmare is a bad dream. The person who has a nightmare wakes up from the dream and may remember details. A person who has a sleep terror remains asleep. Children usually don't remember anything about their sleep terrors in the morning. Adults may recall part of a dream they had during the sleep terrors. Sleep terrors generally happen in the first part of sleep time, and rarely during naps. A sleep terror may lead to sleepwalking. During a sleep terror, a person may: Start by screaming, shouting or crying. Sit up in bed and look scared. Stare wide-eyed. Sweat, breathe heavily, and have a racing pulse, flushed face and enlarged pupils. Kick and thrash. Be hard to wake up and be confused if awakened. Not be comforted or soothed. Have no or little memory of the event the next morning. Possibly, get out of bed and run around the house or have aggressive behavior if blocked or held back. When to see a doctor Occasional sleep terrors aren't usually a cause for concern. If your child has sleep terrors, you can simply mention them at a routine well-child exam. But if you have concerns for you or your child, talk to your doctor or other healthcare professional sooner, especially if sleep terrors: Happen more often. Regularly disrupt the sleep of the person with sleep terrors or other family members. Lead to safety concerns or injury. Result in daytime symptoms of extreme sleepiness or problems with daily activities. Continue beyond the teen years or start as an adult. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Niemann-Pick disease,"The three main types of Niemann-Pick disease are called A, B and C. Symptoms differ widely but depend in part on the type and how severe the condition is. Symptoms may include: Loss of muscle control, such as clumsiness and problems walking. Muscle weakness and floppiness. Stiff and awkward movements. Vision problems, such as vision loss and eye movements that can't be controlled. Hearing loss. Being sensitive to touch. Problems sleeping. Problems swallowing and eating. Slurred speech. Problems with learning and memory that get worse. Mental health conditions, such as depression, paranoia and behavior problems. Liver and spleen that get too large. Repeated infections that cause pneumonia. Some infants with type A show symptoms within the first few months of life. Those with type B may not show symptoms for years and have a better chance of living to adulthood. People with type C can start to have symptoms at any age but may not have any symptoms until adulthood. When to see a doctor If you have concerns about your child's growth and development, talk with your healthcare professional. If your child is no longer able to do some activities that could be done before, see your healthcare professional right away. Request an appointment"
Peripheral neuropathy,"Every nerve in the peripheral system has a specific job. Symptoms depend on the type of nerves affected. Nerves are divided into: Sensory nerves that receive sensation, such as temperature, pain, vibration or touch, from the skin. Motor nerves that control muscle movement. Autonomic nerves that control functions such as blood pressure, sweating, heart rate, digestion and bladder function. Symptoms of peripheral neuropathy might include: Gradual onset of numbness, prickling, or tingling in your feet or hands. These sensations can spread upward into your legs and arms. Sharp, jabbing, throbbing or burning pain. Extreme sensitivity to touch. Pain during activities that shouldn't cause pain, such as pain in your feet when putting weight on them or when they're under a blanket. Lack of coordination and falling. Muscle weakness. Feeling as if you're wearing gloves or socks when you're not. Inability to move if motor nerves are affected. If autonomic nerves are affected, symptoms might include: Heat intolerance. Excessive sweating or not being able to sweat. Bowel, bladder or digestive problems. Drops in blood pressure, causing dizziness or lightheadedness. Peripheral neuropathy can affect one nerve, called mononeuropathy. If it affects two or more nerves in different areas, it's called multiple mononeuropathy, and if it affects many nerves, it's called polyneuropathy. Carpal tunnel syndrome is an example of mononeuropathy. Most people with peripheral neuropathy have polyneuropathy. When to see a doctor Seek medical care right away if you notice unusual tingling, weakness, or pain in your hands or feet. Early diagnosis and treatment give you the best chance for controlling your symptoms and preventing further damage to your peripheral nerves. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Neurofibromatosis type 1,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) usually is diagnosed during childhood. Symptoms are seen at birth or shortly afterward and almost always by age 10. Symptoms tend to be mild to moderate, but they can vary from person to person. Symptoms include: Flat, light brown spots on the skin, known as cafe au lait spots. These harmless spots are common in many people. But having more than six cafe au lait spots suggests NF1. They often are present at birth or appear during the first years of life. After childhood, new spots stop appearing. Freckling in the armpits or groin area. Freckling often appears by ages 3 to 5. Freckles are smaller than cafe au lait spots and tend to occur in clusters in skin folds. Tiny bumps on the iris of the eye, known as Lisch nodules. These nodules can't easily be seen and don't affect vision. Soft, pea-sized bumps on or under the skin called neurofibromas. These benign tumors usually grow in or under the skin but can also grow inside the body. A growth that involves many nerves is called a plexiform neurofibroma. Plexiform neurofibromas, when located on the face, can cause disfigurement. Neurofibromas may increase in number with age. Bone changes. Changes in bone development and low bone mineral density can cause bones to form in an irregular way. People with NF1 may have a curved spine, known as scoliosis, or a bowed lower leg. Tumor on the nerve that connects the eye to the brain, called an optic pathway glioma. This tumor usually appears by age 3. The tumor rarely appears in late childhood and among teenagers, and almost never in adults. Learning disabilities. It's common for children with NF1 to have some trouble with learning. Often there is a specific learning disability, such as trouble with reading or math. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and speech delay also are common. Larger than average head size. Children with NF1 tend to have a larger than average head size due to increased brain volume. Short stature. Children who have NF1 often are below average in height. When to see a doctor See a healthcare professional if your child has symptoms of neurofibromatosis type 1. The tumors are often not cancerous and are slow growing, but complications can be managed. If your child has a plexiform neurofibroma, a medicine is available to treat it. Request an appointment"
Neurofibroma,"A neurofibroma might cause no symptoms. If symptoms occur, they're usually mild. When a neurofibroma grows on or under the skin, symptoms may include: A bump on the skin. The bump may be the color of your skin or pink or tan. Pain. Bleeding. If a neurofibroma becomes large or presses against or grows on a nerve, symptoms may include: Pain. Tingling. Numbness or weakness. Change in appearance when a large neurofibroma is on the face. Some people with neurofibromas have a genetic condition known as neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). A person with NF1 may have many neurofibromas. The number of neurofibromas increases with age. A tumor that involves many nerves, known as a plexiform neurofibroma, can occur in a person with NF1. This type of neurofibroma can grow large and cause pain. It also can become cancerous. Request an appointment"
Neuroendocrine tumors,"Neuroendocrine tumors don't always cause signs and symptoms at first. The symptoms you might experience depend on the location of your tumor and whether it produces excess hormones. In general, neuroendocrine tumor signs and symptoms might include: Pain from a growing tumor A growing lump you can feel under the skin Feeling unusually tired Losing weight without trying Neuroendocrine tumors that produce excess hormones (functional tumors) might cause: Skin flushing Diarrhea Frequent urination Increased thirst Dizziness Shakiness Skin rash When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any persistent signs and symptoms that worry you."
Vasovagal syncope,"Before you faint due to vasovagal syncope, you may experience some of the following symptoms: Change in skin color. Lightheadedness. Tunnel vision — your field of vision narrows so that you see only what's in front of you. Upset stomach. Feeling warm. A cold, clammy sweat. Blurred vision. During a vasovagal syncope episode, people around you may notice: Jerky movements. A slow, weak pulse. Dilated pupils. Recovery after a vasovagal episode generally begins in less than a minute. However, if you stand up too soon after fainting — within about 15 to 30 minutes — you're at risk of fainting again. When to see a doctor Fainting can be a sign of a more serious condition, such as a heart or brain condition. You may want to consult your healthcare professional after a fainting spell, especially if you've never had one before. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Schwannomatosis,"Schwannomatosis symptoms depend on the type. NF2-related schwannomatosis Symptoms of NF2-related schwannomatosis (NF2) usually result from slow-growing tumors in both ears, known as acoustic neuromas or vestibular schwannomas. The tumors are benign, which means that they are not cancerous. The tumors grow on the nerve that carries sound and balance information from the inner ear to the brain. These tumors can cause hearing loss. Symptoms tend to appear during the late teen and early adult years, and can vary. Symptoms may include: Gradual hearing loss. Ringing in the ears. Poor balance. Headaches. Sometimes NF2 can lead to the growth of tumors on other nerves, including in the brain, spine and eyes. They also can grow on peripheral nerves, which are located outside of the brain and spinal cord. People who have NF2 also may develop other benign tumors. Symptoms of these tumors can include: Numbness and weakness in the arms or legs. Pain. Poor balance. Facial drop. Changes in vision or cataracts. Seizures. Headaches. SMARCB1- and LZTR1-related schwannomatosis These two types of schwannomatosis typically affect people after age 20. Symptoms usually appear between ages 25 and 30. SMARCB1- and LZTR1-related schwannomatosis can cause tumors to grow on nerves in the brain, spine and eyes. Tumors also may grow on peripheral nerves located outside of the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms of SMARCB1- and LZTR1-related schwannomatosis include: Long-lasting pain, which can occur anywhere in the body and can be disabling. Numbness or weakness in various parts of the body. Loss of muscle, known as atrophy. These types of schwannomatosis also can cause tumors to grow in the ear. But it happens rarely, and tumors usually grow in only one ear. This differs from NF2, which causes tumors to grow in both ears. For this reason, people with SMARCB1- and LZTR1-related schwannomatosis don't have the same hearing loss as people who have NF2. When to see a doctor See a healthcare professional if you have symptoms of schwannomatosis. Although there is no cure, complications can be treated. Request an appointment"
Trigeminal neuralgia,"Branches of the trigeminal nerve Enlarge image Close Branches of the trigeminal nerve Branches of the trigeminal nerve Trigeminal neuralgia results in pain occurring in an area of the face supplied by one or more of the three branches of the trigeminal nerve. Trigeminal neuralgia symptoms may include one or more of these patterns: Episodes of intense shooting or jabbing pain that may feel like an electric shock. Sudden episodes of pain or pain triggered by touching the face, chewing, speaking or brushing your teeth. Episodes of pain lasting from a few seconds to several minutes. Pain that occurs with facial spasms. Episodes of pain lasting days, weeks, months or longer. Some people have periods when they experience no pain. Pain in areas supplied by the trigeminal nerve. These areas include the cheek, jaw, teeth, gums or lips. Less often, the eye and forehead may be affected. Pain on one side of the face at a time. Pain focused in one spot. Or the pain may be spread in a wider pattern. Pain that rarely occurs while sleeping. Episodes of pain that become more frequent and intense over time. When to see a doctor See your healthcare professional if you experience pain in your face, particularly if it's long-lasting or comes back after going away. Also get medical attention if you have chronic pain that doesn't go away with pain medicine that you buy off the shelf. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Postherpetic neuralgia,"In general, the symptoms of postherpetic neuralgia are limited to the area of skin where the shingles outbreak first happened. That's commonly in a band around the trunk of the body, most often on one side. The symptoms might include: Pain that lasts three months or longer after the shingles rash has healed. The pain may feel burning, sharp and jabbing. Or it may feel deep and aching. Not being able to stand light touch. People with postherpetic neuralgia often can't bear even the touch of clothing on the affected skin. Itching or loss of feeling. Less often, postherpetic neuralgia can cause an itchy feeling or numbness. When to see a doctor See a health care provider at the first sign of shingles. Often the pain starts before you notice a rash. The risk of postherpetic neuralgia becomes lower if you start taking virus-fighting medicines called antivirals within 72 hours of getting the shingles rash. Request an appointment"
Nephrotic syndrome,
Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis,"Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis can begin days to months, and even years, after exposure to an older gadolinium-based contrast agent (group 1). Some signs and symptoms of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis may include: Swelling and tightening of the skin Reddened or darkened patches on the skin Thickening and hardening of the skin, typically on the arms and legs and sometimes on the body, but almost never on the face or head Skin that may feel ""woody"" and develop an orange-peel appearance Burning, itching or severe sharp pains in areas of involvement Skin thickening that inhibits movement, resulting in loss of joint flexibility Rarely, blisters or ulcers In some people, involvement of muscles and body organs may cause: Muscle weakness Limitation of joint motion caused by muscle tightening (contractures) in arms, hands, legs and feet Bone pain, particularly in the hip bones or ribs Reduced internal organ function, including heart, lung, diaphragm, gastrointestinal tract or liver Yellow plaques on the white surface (sclera) of the eyes The condition is generally long term (chronic), but some people may improve.

Nasal polyps,"Nasal polyps are linked to irritation and swelling, also called inflammation, of the inside of the nose and sinuses that lasts more than 12 weeks. This is known as chronic sinusitis. But it's possible to have chronic sinusitis without getting nasal polyps. People who have small nasal polyps might not know they have them. But having more than one polyp or having a large polyp can block the nose. Common symptoms of chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps include: Runny, stuffy nose. Mucus running down the throat, also known as postnasal drip. Not being able to smell. Not being able to taste. Facial pain or headache. Pain in the teeth. A sense of pressure over the forehead and face. Snoring. When to see a doctor See a health care provider for symptoms that last more than 10 days.

Narcissistic personality disorder,"Symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder and how severe they are can vary. People with the disorder can: Have an unreasonably high sense of self-importance and require constant, excessive admiration. Feel that they deserve privileges and special treatment. Expect to be recognized as superior even without achievements. Make achievements and talents seem bigger than they are. Be preoccupied with fantasies about success, power, brilliance, beauty or the perfect mate. Believe they are superior to others and can only spend time with or be understood by equally special people. Be critical of and look down on people they feel are not important. Expect special favors and expect other people to do what they want without questioning them. Take advantage of others to get what they want. Have an inability or unwillingness to recognize the needs and feelings of others. Be envious of others and believe others envy them. Behave in an arrogant way, brag a lot and come across as conceited. Insist on having the best of everything — for instance, the best car or office. At the same time, people with narcissistic personality disorder have trouble handling anything they view as criticism. They can: Become impatient or angry when they don't receive special recognition or treatment. Have major problems interacting with others and easily feel slighted. React with rage or contempt and try to belittle other people to make themselves appear superior. Have difficulty managing their emotions and behavior. Experience major problems dealing with stress and adapting to change. Withdraw from or avoid situations in which they might fail. Feel depressed and moody because they fall short of perfection. Have secret feelings of insecurity, shame, humiliation and fear of being exposed as a failure. When to see a doctor People with narcissistic personality disorder may not want to think that anything could be wrong, so they usually don't seek treatment. If they do seek treatment, it's more likely to be for symptoms of depression, drug or alcohol misuse, or another mental health problem. What they view as insults to self-esteem may make it difficult to accept and follow through with treatment. If you recognize aspects of your personality that are common to narcissistic personality disorder or you're feeling overwhelmed by sadness, consider reaching out to a trusted health care provider or mental health provider. Getting the right treatment can help make your life more rewarding and enjoyable. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Multiple system atrophy,"Multiple system atrophy (MSA) symptoms affect many parts of the body. Symptoms start in adulthood, usually in the 50s or 60s. There are two types of MSA: parkinsonian and cerebellar. The type depends on the symptoms a person has when diagnosed. Parkinsonian type This is the most common type of MSA. Symptoms are similar to those of Parkinson's disease, such as: Stiff muscles. Trouble bending the arms and legs. Slow movement, known as bradykinesia. Tremors at rest or when moving the arms or legs. Slurred, slow or soft speech, known as dysarthria. Trouble with posture and balance. Cerebellar type The main symptoms of the cerebellar type involve poor muscle coordination, known as ataxia. Symptoms may include: Trouble with movement and coordination. This includes loss of balance and not being able to walk steadily. Slurred, slow or soft speech, known as dysarthria. Changes in vision. This may include blurred or double vision and not being able to focus the eyes. Trouble chewing or swallowing, known as dysphagia. General symptoms For both types of multiple system atrophy, the autonomic nervous system doesn't work properly. The autonomic nervous system controls involuntary functions in the body, such as blood pressure. When this system doesn't work properly, it can cause the following symptoms. Postural hypotension, also known as orthostatic hypotension Postural hypotension is a form of low blood pressure. People who have this type of low blood pressure feel dizzy or lightheaded when they stand up after sitting or lying down. They may even faint. Not everyone with MSA has postural hypotension. People with MSA also can develop dangerously high blood pressure levels while lying down. This is called supine hypertension. Urinary and bowel symptoms These symptoms include: Constipation. Loss of bladder or bowel control, known as incontinence. Changes in sweat production People with multiple system atrophy may: Produce less sweat. Have heat intolerance because they sweat less. Have poor body temperature control, often causing cold hands or feet. Conditions that affect sleep Sleep symptoms may include: Agitated sleep due to ""acting out"" dreams. This is known as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder. Breathing that stops and starts during sleep, known as sleep apnea. A high-pitched whistling sound while breathing, called stridor. Sexual symptoms These symptoms may include: Trouble getting or keeping an erection, known as erectile dysfunction. Trouble with lubrication during sex and having an orgasm. Loss of interest in sex. Cardiovascular symptoms MSA may cause: Color changes in the hands and feet. Psychiatric symptoms People with multiple system atrophy also may experience: Trouble controlling emotions, such as laughing or crying when not expected. When to see a doctor If you develop any of the symptoms of multiple system atrophy, see your healthcare professional. If you have already been diagnosed with MSA, contact your healthcare professional if your symptoms become worse or if new symptoms occur. Request an appointment"
Multiple sclerosis,"Myelin damage and the nervous system Enlarge image Close Myelin damage and the nervous system Myelin damage and the nervous system In multiple sclerosis, the protective coating on nerve fibers, known as myelin, in the central nervous system is damaged. Depending on the location of the damage in the central nervous system, symptoms may happen, including numbness, tingling, weakness, visual changes, bladder and bowel troubles, memory troubles, or mood changes, for example. Multiple sclerosis symptoms vary depending on the person. Symptoms may change over the course of the disease depending on which nerve fibers are affected. Common symptoms include: Numbness or tingling. Electric-shock sensations that happen with certain neck movements, especially bending the neck forward. This sensation is called Lhermitte sign. Lack of coordination. Trouble with walking or not being able to walk at all. Weakness. Partial or complete loss of vision, usually in one eye at a time. Vision loss often happens with pain during eye movement. Double vision. Blurry vision. Dizziness and a false sense that you or your surroundings are moving, known as vertigo. Trouble with sexual, bowel and bladder function. Fatigue. Slurred speech. Troubles with memory, thinking and understanding information. Mood changes. Small increases in body temperature can temporarily worsen symptoms of MS. These aren't considered true disease relapses but pseudorelapses.

Moyamoya disease,"Moyamoya disease may happen at any age. But symptoms are most common in children between ages 5 and 10 and in adults between ages 30 and 50. Spotting symptoms early is very important to prevent complications such as a stroke. Moyamoya disease causes different symptoms in adults and children. In children, the first symptom is usually a stroke or recurrent transient ischemic attack, also called TIA. Adults may experience these symptoms, as well. But adults also may experience bleeding in the brain, known as a hemorrhagic stroke. The bleeding happens because of the way blood vessels in the brain formed. Symptoms of moyamoya disease related to reduced blood flow to the brain include: Headache. Seizures. Weakness, numbness or paralysis in the face, arm or leg. This is typically on one side of the body. Vision problems. Trouble speaking or understanding others, known as aphasia. Cognitive or developmental delays. Involuntary movements. These symptoms can be triggered by exercise, crying, coughing, straining or a fever. See your healthcare professional if you have any of the symptoms of moyamoya disease. Early detection and treatment can help prevent a stroke and serious complications. When to see a doctor Seek immediate medical attention if you notice any symptoms of a stroke or ministroke, even if the symptoms seem to come and go or disappear. To check for signs of stroke, think ""FAST"" and do the following: Face. Ask the person to smile. Does one side of the face droop? Arms. Ask the person to raise both arms. Does one arm drift downward? Or is one arm unable to rise up? Speech. Ask the person to repeat a simple phrase. Is the person's speech slurred or strange? Time. If you observe any of these signs, call 911 or emergency medical help right away. Don't wait to see if symptoms go away. Every minute counts. The longer a stroke goes untreated, the greater the potential for brain damage and disability. If you're with someone you suspect is having a stroke, watch the person carefully while waiting for emergency assistance. Request an appointment"
Movement disorders,"Symptoms of movement disorders vary depending on the type of the disorder. Common types of movement disorders and their symptoms include: Ataxia. Ataxia affects the part of the brain that controls coordinated movement. Ataxia may cause clumsy movements of the arms and legs, and a loss of balance. Ataxia also can change a person's speech and cause other symptoms. There are many causes of ataxia, including genetic and degenerative conditions. Ataxia also may be caused by an infection or another treatable condition. Chorea. Chorea causes brief, irregular, somewhat rapid, involuntary movements that happen over and over. The movements typically involve the face, mouth, trunk, arm and leg. Chorea can look like exaggerated fidgeting. The most common genetic chorea is Huntington's disease. This disease is passed down from a parent and gets worse over time. It can be confirmed with genetic testing. Huntington's disease has three types of symptoms. They include movements that can't be controlled, trouble with thinking and mental health conditions. Dystonia. This condition involves involuntary muscle contractions that cause twisting, irregular postures, or movements that occur again and again. Dystonia may affect the entire body or one part of the body. The most common type of dystonia in adults is cervical dystonia. In cervical dystonia, the neck muscles contract involuntarily. This causes the head to pull to one side or to tilt forward or backward. The head also may shake, known as a tremor. Functional movement disorder. This condition may look like any of the movement disorders. But it's not caused by a disease of the nervous system, also known as a neurological disease. Functional movement disorders are treatable. Multiple system atrophy. This rare condition affects many brain systems and gets worse over time. Multiple system atrophy causes a movement disorder, such as ataxia or parkinsonism. It also can cause low blood pressure, bladder symptoms and acting out dreams. Myoclonus. Myoclonus are very quick jerks of a muscle. Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease causes tremors, muscle stiffness, slow or decreased movement, or loss of balance. It also can cause symptoms not related to movement. These symptoms include a reduced sense of smell, constipation, acting out dreams and a decline in thinking skills. Parkinson's disease slowly gets worse over time. Parkinsonism. Parkinsonism is a general term for slowness of movement along with stiffness, tremors or loss of balance. There are many different causes. Parkinson's disease and certain dopamine blocking medicines are the most common causes. Other causes include degenerative disorders such as multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy. Stroke or repeated head trauma also can cause parkinsonism. Progressive supranuclear palsy. This is a rare nervous system condition that causes problems with walking, balance and eye movements. It may resemble Parkinson's disease but is a distinct condition. Restless legs syndrome. This movement disorder causes aching, itching, or creeping feelings in the legs while relaxing or lying down. The feeling often goes away with movement. Tardive dyskinesia. This neurological condition is caused by long-term use of certain medicines used to treat mental health conditions, called neuroleptic medicines. It also can be caused by a common gastrointestinal medicine called metoclopramide (Reglan, Gimoti). Tardive dyskinesia causes involuntary movements that occur over and over. Symptoms include grimacing, eye blinking and other movements. Tourette syndrome. This is a neurological condition associated with repetitive movements and vocal sounds called tics. Tics are voluntary movements, but they're caused by an involuntary urge to make the movements. Tourette syndrome starts between childhood and teenage years. Tremor. This movement disorder causes rhythmic shaking of parts of the body, such as the hands, head or other body parts. The most common type is essential tremor."
Mosquito bites,"Mosquito bites often happen on parts of the body that aren't covered by clothing. Symptoms include: An itchy, inflamed bump that forms a few minutes after a bite A painful spot that looks like a hive and forms within 24 hours after a bite Small blisters A severe reaction to mosquito bites can cause: A large, swollen, inflamed area A hive-like rash Swelling around the eyes Children are more likely to have a severe reaction than are adults.

Molluscum contagiosum,
Moles,"The typical mole is a small brown spot. But moles come in different colors, shapes and sizes: Color and texture. Moles can be brown, tan, black, blue, red or pink. They can be smooth, wrinkled, flat or raised. They may have hair growing from them. Shape. Most moles are oval or round. Size. Moles are typically less than 1/4 inch (about 6 mm) in diameter — the size of a pencil eraser. Those present at birth, known as congenital nevi, can be bigger and cover part of the face, trunk or a limb. Moles can grow anywhere on your body, including your scalp and armpits, as well as under your nails and between your fingers and toes. Most people have 10 to 45 moles. Many of these moles occur by age 40. Moles may change or fade away over time. They may become darker and larger with hormonal changes that occur during the teenage years and while pregnant. Clusters of brown spots around the eyes, cheeks and nose are dermatoses papulosa nigra — a type of seborrheic keratosis that is noncancerous and appears as waxy brown, black or tan growths. They aren't clusters of pigment-forming cells, known as nevi. Dermatoses papulosa nigra are more common among Black women. These lesions don't carry a risk of melanoma, but they can be treated as a cosmetic concern. Unusual moles that may indicate melanoma A mole may be a sign of skin cancer if it has irregular borders or an asymmetrical shape, or if it changes in color, shape, size or height. This ABCDE guide can help you remember what to watch for: A is for asymmetrical shape. One half is unlike the other half. B is for border. Look for moles with irregular, notched or scalloped borders. C is for changes in color. Look for growths that have changed color, have many colors or have uneven color. D is for diameter. Look for new growth in a mole larger than 1/4 inch (about 6 mm). E is for evolving. Watch for moles that change in size, shape, color or height. Also, new symptoms can arise, such as itchiness or bleeding. Cancerous moles, also known as malignant moles, vary greatly in how they look. Some may show all of the changes listed above. Others may have only one or two unusual traits. When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your healthcare professional if a mole looks unusual, grows or otherwise changes. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD),"MOGAD causes painful swelling, known as inflammation. Symptoms are caused by attacks from: Inflammation of the optic nerve. Called optic neuritis, this condition may lead to vision loss in one or both eyes and eye pain that gets worse with eye movement. Optic neuritis in children may be mistaken for a headache. Inflammation of the spinal cord. Called transverse myelitis, this condition may lead to arm or leg weakness, muscle stiffness, or paralysis. It also may cause sensory loss and changes in bowel, bladder or sexual function. Inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. Called acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, also known as ADEM, this condition may lead to vision loss, weakness, unsteady walk and confusion. ADEM is more common in children with MOGAD . Other symptoms of MOGAD may include: Seizures. Headaches. Fever. Disease course Some people who have MOGAD only experience one attack of symptoms. This is called monophasic MOGAD and is slightly more common. However, some people experience multiple attacks, called relapsing MOGAD . Attacks usually develop over days and can be severe and debilitating. Disability usually gets worse with each attack. Attack recovery can take weeks to months.

Mixed connective tissue disease,
Mittelschmerz,"Mittelschmerz pain usually lasts a few minutes to a few hours, but it may continue for as long as a day or two. Pain from mittelschmerz may be: On one side of your lower abdomen Dull and achy, similar to menstrual cramps Sharp and sudden Accompanied by slight vaginal bleeding or discharge Rarely, severe Mittelschmerz pain occurs on the side of the ovary that's releasing an egg (ovulating). The pain may switch sides every other month, or you may feel pain on the same side for several months. Keep track of your menstrual cycle for several months and note when you feel lower abdominal pain. If it occurs midcycle and goes away without treatment, it's most likely mittelschmerz. When to see a doctor Mittelschmerz rarely requires medical intervention. However, contact your doctor if a new pelvic pain becomes severe, if it's accompanied by nausea or fever, or if it persists — any of which could indicate you have a condition more serious than mittelschmerz, such as appendicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease or even an ectopic pregnancy.

Menopause,"Most often, menopause happens over time. The months or years leading up to menopause are called perimenopause or the menopausal transition. During the transition, the amount of hormones your ovaries make varies. Perimenopause can last 2 to 8 years. The average is about four years. The hormone changes can cause symptoms such as: Irregular periods. Vaginal dryness. Hot flashes. Night sweats. Sleep problems. Mood changes. Trouble finding words and remembering, often called brain fog. Different people have different menopause symptoms. Most often, periods are not regular before they end. Skipped periods during perimenopause are common and expected. Often, menstrual periods skip a month and return. Or they skip a few months and then start monthly cycles again for a few months. Period cycles tend to get shorter in early perimenopause, so periods are closer together. As menopause gets closer, periods get farther apart for months before they end. You can still get pregnant during this time. If you've skipped a period but aren't sure it's due to menopause, think about taking a pregnancy test. When to see a doctor Keep seeing your healthcare professional for wellness visits and medical concerns before, during and after menopause.

Melanoma,"Moles Enlarge image Close Moles Moles Moles are usually harmless. They may contain hairs or become raised or wrinkled. Talk to your doctor about any change in the color or size of a mole or if itching, pain, bleeding or inflammation develops. Melanoma Enlarge image Close Melanoma Melanoma The first sign of melanoma is often a mole that changes size, shape or color. This melanoma shows color variations and an irregular border, both of which are melanoma warning signs. The first melanoma signs and symptoms often are: A change in an existing mole. The development of a new pigmented or unusual-looking growth on the skin. Melanoma doesn't always begin as a mole. It also can happen on otherwise healthy skin. Melanomas symptoms can happen anywhere on the body. Melanomas most often develop in areas that have had exposure to the sun. This includes the arms, back, face and legs. Melanomas also can happen in areas that aren't as exposed to the sun. This includes the soles of the feet, palms of the hands and fingernail beds. Melanoma also can happen inside the body. These hidden melanomas are more common in people with brown or Black skin. Typical moles Typical moles are generally a uniform color. They might look pink, tan, brown or black. In people with brown and Black skin, typical moles are more likely to be dark brown or black. Typical moles have a distinct border separating the mole from the surrounding skin. They're oval or round and usually smaller than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters) in diameter. Most moles begin appearing in childhood and new moles may form until about age 40. By the time they are adults, most people have between 10 and 40 moles. Moles may change in appearance over time and some may even go away with age. Signs that may indicate melanoma Some moles aren't typical. They may have certain characteristics that indicate melanomas or other skin cancers. Characteristics may include: Asymmetrical shape. Look for moles with unusual shapes, such as two very different-looking halves. Changes in color. Look for growths that have many colors or unusual color patterns. Changes in size. Look for new growth in a mole larger than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters). Changes in symptoms. Look for changes in symptoms, such as new itchiness or bleeding. Unusual border. Look for moles with unusual, notched or scalloped borders. Moles that become cancers can all look very different. Some may show all of the changes listed above, while others may have only one or two unusual characteristics. Hidden melanomas Melanomas also can develop in areas of the body that have little or no exposure to the sun. These areas may include the spaces between the toes and on the palms, soles, scalp or genitals. These are sometimes referred to as hidden melanomas because they occur in places most people wouldn't think to check. When melanoma occurs in people with brown or Black skin, it's more likely to occur in a hidden area. Hidden melanomas include: Melanoma inside the body. Mucosal melanoma develops in the mucous membrane. This tissue lines the nose, mouth, esophagus, anus, urinary tract and vagina. Mucosal melanomas are especially difficult to detect because they can easily be mistaken for other far more common conditions. Melanoma in the eye. Eye melanoma also is called ocular melanoma. It most often occurs in the layer of tissue beneath the white of the eye. This layer is called the uvea. An eye melanoma may cause vision changes and may be diagnosed during an eye exam. Melanoma under a nail. Acral-lentiginous melanoma is a rare form of melanoma that can occur under a fingernail or toenail. It also can be found on the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet. Acral-lentiginous melanoma tends to be very dark, flat and have very unusual borders. It's more common in people of Asian descent and people with brown or Black skin.

Swollen lymph nodes,
Lyme disease,"A tick bite may look like as a tiny, itchy bump on your skin, much like a mosquito bite. This doesn't mean you have a tick-borne disease. Many people will not notice they've had a tick bite. The symptoms of Lyme disease vary. They usually show up in stages. But the stages can overlap. And some people don't have symptoms of the typical early stage. Stage 1 Lyme disease rash Enlarge image Close Lyme disease rash Lyme disease rash Illustration of Lyme disease rash on different skin colors. People with Lyme disease might get a bull's-eye rash. The rash gradually spreads over a period of days. Early symptoms of Lyme disease usually happen within 3 to 30 days after a tick bite. This stage of disease has a limited set of symptoms. This is called early localized disease. A rash is a common sign of Lyme disease. But it doesn't always happen. The rash is usually a single circle that slowly spreads from the site of the tick bite. It may become clear in the center and look like a target or bull's-eye. The rash often feels warm to the touch, But it's usually not painful or itchy. Other stage 1 symptoms include: Fever. Headache. Extreme tiredness. Joint stiffness. Muscle aches and pains. Swollen lymph nodes. Stage 2 Without treatment, Lyme disease can get worse.  The symptoms often show up within 3 to 10 weeks after a tick bite. Stage 2 is often more serious and widespread. It is called early disseminated disease. Stage 2 may include the stage 1 symptoms and the following: Many rashes on other parts of the body. Neck pain or stiffness. Muscle weakness on one or both sides of the face. Immune-system activity in heart tissue that causes irregular heartbeats. Pain that starts from the back and hips and spreads to the legs. Pain, numbness or weakness in the hands or feet. Painful swelling in tissues of the eye or eyelid. Immune-system activity in eye nerves that causes pain or vision loss. Stage 3 In the third stage, you may have symptoms from the earlier stages and other symptoms. This stage is called late disseminated disease. In the United States, the most common condition of this stage is arthritis in large joints, particularly the knees. Pain, swelling or stiffness may last for a long time. Or the symptoms may come and go. Stage 3 symptoms usually begin 2 to 12 months after a tick bite. The type of Lyme disease common in Europe can cause a skin condition called acrodermatitis chronic atrophicans. The skin on the backs of the hands and tops of the feet get discolored and swell. It also may show up over the elbows and knees. More-serious cases may cause damage to tissues or joints. This skin condition may show up many months to many years after a tick bite. When to see a doctor Most people who get Lyme disease don't remember having a tick bite. And many symptoms of Lyme disease relate to other conditions. See your health care provider if you have Lyme disease symptoms. An early diagnosis and proper treatment can improve outcomes. If you know you had a tick bite or might have been around ticks, watch for symptoms. If they show up, see your care provider as soon as possible. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Long QT syndrome,"The most common symptom of long QT syndrome is fainting, also called syncope. A fainting spell from LQTS can happen with little to no warning. Fainting happens when the heart beats in an irregular way for a short time. You might faint when you're excited, angry or scared, or during exercise. If you have LQTS , things that startle you can cause you to pass out, such as a loud ringtone or an alarm clock. Before fainting happens, some people with long QT syndrome might have symptoms such as: Blurred vision. Lightheadedness. Pounding heartbeats called palpitations. Weakness. Long QT syndrome also can cause seizures in some people. Babies born with LQTS may have symptoms during the first weeks to months of life. Sometimes the symptoms start later in childhood. Most people born with LQTS have symptoms by age 40. Symptoms of long QT syndrome sometimes happen during sleep. Some people with long QT syndrome (LQTS) do not notice any symptoms. The disorder may be found during a heart test called an electrocardiogram. Or it may be discovered when genetic tests are done for other reasons. When to see a doctor Make an appointment for a health checkup if you faint or if you feel like you have a pounding or fast heartbeat. Tell your healthcare team if you have a parent, brother, sister or child with long QT syndrome. Long QT syndrome can run in families, which means it can be inherited. Request an appointment"
Tetanus,"The average time from infection to appearance of signs and symptoms (incubation period) is 10 days. The incubation period can range from 3 to 21 days. The most common type of tetanus is called generalized tetanus. Signs and symptoms begin gradually and then progressively worsen over two weeks. They usually start at the jaw and progress downward on the body. Signs and symptoms of generalized tetanus include: Painful muscle spasms and stiff, immovable muscles (muscle rigidity) in your jaw Tension of muscles around your lips, sometimes producing a persistent grin Painful spasms and rigidity in your neck muscles Difficulty swallowing Rigid abdominal muscles Progression of tetanus results in repeated painful, seizure-like spasms that last for several minutes (generalized spasms). Usually, the neck and back arch, the legs become rigid, the arms are drawn up to the body, and the fists are clenched. Muscle rigidity in the neck and abdomen may cause breathing difficulties. These severe spasms may be triggered by minor events that stimulate the senses — a loud sound, a physical touch, a draft or light. As the disease progresses, other signs and symptoms may include: High blood pressure Low blood pressure Rapid heart rate Fever Extreme sweating Localized tetanus This uncommon form of tetanus results in muscles spasms near the site of a wound. While it's usually a less severe form of disease, it can progress to generalized tetanus. Cephalic tetanus This rare form of tetanus results from a head wound. It results in weakened muscles in the face and spasms of the jaw muscles. It also can progress to generalized tetanus. When to see a doctor Tetanus is a life-threatening disease. If you have signs or symptoms of tetanus, seek emergency care. If you have a simple, clean wound — and you've had a tetanus shot within 10 years — you can care for your wound at home. Seek medical care in the following cases: You've not had a tetanus shot within 10 years. You are unsure of when you last had a tetanus shot. You have a puncture wound, a foreign object in your wound, an animal bite or a deep cut. Your wound is contaminated with dirt, soil, feces, rust or saliva — or you have any doubt about whether you've cleaned a wound sufficiently after such exposure. Contaminated wounds require a vaccination booster if it's been five or more years since your last tetanus shot. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Lead poisoning,
Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS),
Lactose intolerance,
Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome,"People who have KTS may have the following features, which can range from mild to more extensive: Port-wine stain. This pink to reddish-purple birthmark is caused by extra tiny blood vessels (capillaries) in the top layer of skin. The birthmark often covers part of one leg but can involve any portion of the skin. It may get darker or lighter with age. Vein malformations. These include swollen, twisted veins (varicose veins), usually on the surface of the legs. Deeper malformed veins in the arms, legs, abdomen and pelvis also can occur. There may be spongy tissue filled with small veins in or under the skin. Malformed veins may become more prominent with age. Overgrowth of bones and soft tissue. This begins in infancy and may be limited to one leg, but it can occur in an arm or, rarely, in the trunk or face. This overgrowth of bone and tissue creates a larger and longer extremity. Rarely, there may be fusion of fingers or toes or extra fingers or toes. Lymphatic system malformations. The lymphatic system — part of the immune system that protects against infection and disease and transports lymphatic fluid — can be malformed. Extra lymphatic vessels can be present that don't work properly and can lead to fluid leakage into the tissues and swelling. Other conditions. KTS can also include cataracts, glaucoma, hip dislocation at birth, purple-red skin coloring when cold and blood-clotting problems. When to see a doctor KTS is usually identified at birth. It's important to get a prompt, accurate diagnosis and appropriate care to treat symptoms and prevent complications. Request an appointment"

Mononucleosis,
Kidney stones,"Kidney stones Enlarge image Close Kidney stones Kidney stones Kidney stones form in your kidneys. As stones move into your ureters — the thin tubes that allow urine to pass from your kidneys to your bladder — signs and symptoms can result. Signs and symptoms of kidney stones can include severe pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills and blood in your urine. A kidney stone usually will not cause symptoms until it moves around within the kidney or passes into one of the ureters. The ureters are the tubes that connect the kidneys and bladder. If a kidney stone becomes lodged in the ureters, it may block the flow of urine and cause the kidney to swell and the ureter to spasm, which can be very painful. At that point, you may experience these symptoms: Severe, sharp pain in the side and back, below the ribs Pain that radiates to the lower abdomen and groin Pain that comes in waves and fluctuates in intensity Pain or burning sensation while urinating Other signs and symptoms may include: Pink, red or brown urine Cloudy or foul-smelling urine A persistent need to urinate, urinating more often than usual or urinating in small amounts Nausea and vomiting Fever and chills if an infection is present Pain caused by a kidney stone may change — for instance, shifting to a different location or increasing in intensity — as the stone moves through your urinary tract. When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any signs and symptoms that worry you. Seek immediate medical attention if you experience: Pain so severe that you can't sit still or find a comfortable position Pain accompanied by nausea and vomiting Pain accompanied by fever and chills Blood in your urine Difficulty passing urine Request an appointment There is a problem with

Kawasaki disease,"Symptoms of Kawasaki disease include a fever greater than 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit (39 degrees Celsius) for five or more days. And the child  has at least four of the following symptoms. A rash on the main part of the body or in the genital area. An enlarged lymph node in the neck. Very red eyes without a thick discharge. Red, dry, cracked lips and a red, swollen tongue. Swollen, red skin on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. Later the skin on fingers and toes peels. The symptoms might not happen at the same time. Let your child's healthcare professional know about a symptom that has gone away. Other symptoms might include: Belly pain. Diarrhea. Fussiness. Joint pain. Vomiting. Some children get a high fever for five or more days but have fewer than four of the symptoms needed for a diagnosis of Kawasaki disease. They might have what's called incomplete Kawasaki disease. Children with incomplete Kawasaki disease are still at risk of damage to the heart arteries. They still need treatment within 10 days of when symptoms appear. Kawasaki disease can have symptoms like those of a condition called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. The syndrome happens in children with COVID-19. When to see a doctor If your child has a fever that lasts more than three days, contact your child's healthcare professional. Treating Kawasaki disease within 10 days of when it began may reduce the chances of lasting damage to the arteries that supply the heart. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Jaw tumors and cysts,"A tumor is an abnormal growth or mass of tissue. A cyst is a lesion that contains liquid or semisolid material. Examples of jaw tumors and cysts include: Ameloblastoma. This rare, usually noncancerous (benign) tumor begins in the cells that form the protective enamel lining on the teeth. It develops most often in the jaw near the molars. The most common type is aggressive, forming large tumors and growing into the jawbone. Although this tumor can recur after treatment, aggressive surgical treatment will typically reduce the chance of recurrence. Central giant cell granuloma. Central giant cell granulomas are benign lesions that grow from bone cells. They most often occur in the front portion of the lower jaw. One type of these tumors can grow rapidly, cause pain and destroy bone, and has a tendency to recur after surgical treatment. The other type is less aggressive and may not have symptoms. Rarely, a tumor may shrink or resolve on its own, but typically these tumors require surgical treatment. Dentigerous cyst. This cyst originates from tissue that surrounds a tooth before it erupts into the mouth. This is the most common form of cyst that affects the jaws. Most often these cysts will occur around wisdom teeth that are not fully erupted, but they can also involve other teeth. Odontogenic keratocyst. This cyst is also referred to as a keratocystic odontogenic tumor because of its tumorlike tendency to recur after surgical treatment. Although this cyst is typically slow growing, it can still be destructive to the jaw and teeth if left untreated over a long period of time. Most often the cyst develops in the lower jaw near the third molars. These cysts may also be found in people with an inherited condition called nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. Odontogenic myxoma. This is a rare, slow-growing, benign tumor that occurs most often in the lower jaw. The tumor can be large and aggressively invade the jaw and surrounding tissue and displace teeth. Odontogenic myxomas are known to recur after surgical treatment; however, the chances of tumor recurrence are typically lessened by more-aggressive forms of surgical treatment. Odontoma. This benign tumor is the most common odontogenic tumor. Odontomas often have no symptoms, but they may interfere with tooth development or eruption. Odontomas are made up of dental tissue that grows around a tooth in the jaw. They can resemble an oddly shaped tooth or can be a small or large calcified tumor. These tumors may be part of some genetic syndromes. Other types of cysts and tumors. These include adenomatoid odontogenic tumor, calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumor, glandular odontogenic cyst, squamous odontogenic tumor, calcifying odontogenic cyst, cementoblastoma, aneurysmal bone cyst, ossifying fibroma, osteoblastoma. central odontogenic fibroma and others. When to see a doctor If you're concerned that you may have symptoms of a jaw tumor or cyst, talk with your primary care provider or dentist. Many times, jaw cysts and tumors do not have symptoms and are typically discovered on routine screening X-rays done for other reasons. If you are diagnosed with or suspected of having a jaw tumor or cyst, your primary care provider can refer you to a specialist for diagnosis and treatment. Request an appointment"

Invasive lobular carcinoma,"At first, invasive lobular carcinoma may cause no signs and symptoms. As it grows larger, invasive lobular carcinoma may cause: A change in the texture or appearance of the skin over the breast, such as dimpling or thickening. A new area of fullness or swelling in the breast. A newly inverted nipple. An area of thickening in part of the breast. Invasive lobular carcinoma is less likely to cause a firm or distinct breast lump than other types of breast cancer. When to see a doctor Make an appointment with a doctor or other healthcare professional if you notice a change in your breasts. Changes to look for may include a lump, an area of puckered or otherwise unusual skin, a thickened region under the skin, and nipple discharge. Ask your healthcare professional when you should consider breast cancer screening and how often it should be repeated. Most healthcare professionals recommend considering routine breast cancer screening beginning in your 40s. Request an appointment There is a problem with information submitted for this request.

Sorry something went wrong with your subscription Please, try again in a couple of minutes Retry Causes Breast anatomy Enlarge image Close Breast anatomy Breast anatomy Each breast contains 15 to 20 lobes of glandular tissue, arranged like the petals of a daisy. The lobes are further divided into smaller lobules that produce milk for breastfeeding. Small tubes, called ducts, conduct the milk to a reservoir that lies just beneath the nipple. It's not clear what causes invasive lobular carcinoma. This form of breast cancer begins when cells in one or more milk-producing glands of the breast develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. In cancer cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. The changes tell the cancer cells to make many more cells quickly. Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells. Invasive lobular carcinoma cells tend to invade breast tissue by spreading out rather than forming a firm lump. The affected area may have a different feel from the surrounding breast tissue. The area may feel more like a thickening and fullness, but it's unlikely to feel like a lump. Risk factors Risk factors for invasive lobular carcinoma are thought to be similar to the risk factors for breast cancer in general. Factors that may increase the risk of breast cancer include: A family history of breast cancer. If a parent, sibling or child had breast cancer, your risk of breast cancer is increased. The risk is higher if your family has a history of getting breast cancer at a young age. The risk also is higher if you have multiple family members with breast cancer. Still, most people diagnosed with breast cancer don't have a family history of the disease. A personal history of breast cancer. If you've had cancer in one breast, you have an increased risk of getting cancer in the other breast. A personal history of breast conditions. Certain breast conditions are signs that you have a higher risk of breast cancer. These conditions include lobular carcinoma in situ, also called LCIS, and atypical hyperplasia of the breast. If you've had a breast biopsy that found one of these conditions, you have an increased risk of breast cancer. Beginning your period at a younger age. Beginning your period before age 12 increases your risk of breast cancer. Beginning menopause at an older age. Beginning menopause after age 55 increases the risk of breast cancer. Being female. Women are much more likely than men are to get breast cancer. Everyone is born with some breast tissue, so anyone can get breast cancer. Dense breast tissue. Breast tissue is made up of fatty tissue and dense tissue. Dense tissue is made of milk glands, milk ducts and fibrous tissue. If you have dense breasts, you have more dense tissue than fatty tissue in your breasts. Having dense breasts can make it harder to detect breast cancer on a mammogram. If a mammogram showed that you have dense breasts, your risk of breast cancer is increased. Talk with your healthcare team about other tests you might have in addition to mammograms to look for breast cancer. Drinking alcohol. Drinking alcohol increases the risk of breast cancer. Having your first child at an older age. Giving birth to your first child after age 30 may increase the risk of breast cancer. Having never been pregnant. Having been pregnant one or more times lowers the risk of breast cancer. Never having been pregnant increases the risk. Inherited DNA changes that increase cancer risk. Certain DNA changes that increase the risk of breast cancer can be passed from parents to children. Two DNA changes associated with an increased risk of invasive lobular carcinoma include BRCA2 and CDH1. BRCA2 increases the risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. CDH1 increases the risk of breast cancer and stomach cancer. CDH1 is closely associated with a rare inherited condition called hereditary diffuse gastric cancer syndrome. Menopausal hormone therapy. Taking certain hormone therapy medicines to control the symptoms of menopause may increase the risk of breast cancer. The risk is linked to hormone therapy medicines that combine estrogen and progesterone. The risk goes down when you stop taking these medicines. Obesity. People with obesity have an increased risk of breast cancer. Older age. Your risk of breast cancer increases as you age. Invasive lobular carcinoma tends to happen at an older age compared to other types of breast cancer. Radiation exposure. If you received radiation treatments to your chest as a child or young adult, your risk of breast cancer is higher. Prevention Making changes in your daily life may help lower your risk of invasive lobular carcinoma and other types of breast cancer. Try to: Ask about breast cancer screening Talk with your doctor or other healthcare professional about when to begin breast cancer screening. Ask about the benefits and risks of screening. Together, you can decide what breast cancer screening tests are right for you. Become familiar with your breasts through breast self-exam You may choose to become familiar with your breasts by occasionally inspecting them during a breast self-exam for breast awareness. If there is a new change, a lump or something not typical in your breasts, report it to a healthcare professional right away. Breast awareness can't prevent breast cancer. But it may help you to better understand the look and feel of your breasts. This might make it more likely that you'll notice if something changes. Drink alcohol in moderation, if at all If you choose to drink alcohol, limit the amount you drink to no more than one drink a day. For breast cancer prevention, there is no safe amount of alcohol. So if you're very concerned about your breast cancer risk, you may choose to not drink alcohol. Exercise most days of the week Aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise on most days of the week. If you haven't been active lately, ask a healthcare professional whether it's OK and start slowly. Limit menopausal hormone therapy Combination hormone therapy may increase the risk of breast cancer. Talk with a healthcare professional about the benefits and risks of hormone therapy. Some people have symptoms during menopause that cause discomfort. These people may decide that the risks of hormone therapy are acceptable in order to get relief. To reduce the risk of breast cancer, use the lowest dose of hormone therapy possible for the shortest amount of time. Maintain a healthy weight If your weight is healthy, work to maintain that weight. If you need to lose weight, ask a healthcare professional about healthy ways to lower your weight. Eat fewer calories and slowly increase the amount of exercise. Talk with a healthcare professional about your cancer risk If you have a family history of breast cancer or feel that you may have an increased risk of breast cancer, talk about it with your healthcare professional. Preventive medicines, surgery and more-frequent screening may be options for people with a high risk of breast cancer.

Pericarditis is grouped into different categories, according to the pattern of symptoms and how long symptoms last. Acute pericarditis begins suddenly but doesn't last longer than four weeks. Future episodes can occur. It may be hard to tell the difference between acute pericarditis and pain due to a heart attack. Recurrent pericarditis occurs about 4 to 6 weeks after a bout of acute pericarditis. No symptoms happen in between. Incessant pericarditis lasts about 4 to 6 weeks but less than three months. The symptoms continue over this whole time. Chronic constrictive pericarditis usually develops slowly and lasts longer than three months. When to see a doctor Get medical care right away if you have new symptoms of chest pain. Many of the symptoms of pericarditis are like those of other heart and lung conditions. It's important to be thoroughly checked by a healthcare professional if you have any type of chest pain. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Idiopathic hypersomnia,"The main symptom of idiopathic hypersomnia is being very sleepy during the day. Symptoms begin slowly over several weeks or months and may include: Having a strong need to sleep. Not being able to stay awake and alert during the day. Sleeping more than 11 hours at night. Having trouble waking up in the morning. Being confused, moving slowly and having trouble with coordination after waking up. Feeling anxiety after waking up.

Have trouble with memory and attention. Rarely, idiopathic hypersomnia can cause someone to fall asleep suddenly during the day. Some people with idiopathic hypersomnia may experience automatic behavior when they are very sleepy. This can include staring, or they may drive without purpose and later realize that they are miles from home. Automatic behavior also may include writing or saying things that don't make sense. Afterward, people with idiopathic hypersomnia don't remember the behavior."
Irritable bowel syndrome,"Symptoms of IBS vary but are usually present for a long time. The most common include: Belly pain, cramping or bloating that is related to passing stool. Changes in appearance of stool. Changes in how often you are passing stool. Other symptoms that are often related include sensation of incomplete evacuation and increased gas or mucus in the stool. Video: How irritable bowel syndrome affects you Show transcript for video Video: How irritable bowel syndrome affects you IBS is a functional disorder. Even though the digestive tract looks normal, it doesn't function as it should. Muscles in the intestines move food from the stomach to the rectum. Normally, they contract and relax in a gentle rhythm that moves the food along in a fairly predictable schedule. But with some people, the muscles in the intestines spasm. That means the contractions are longer and stronger than normal. Those spasms are painful. They also disrupt the movement of food through the intestines. If they slow it down, you become constipated. If they cause it to move through too quickly, you get diarrhea. It's not unusual for people to alternate between the two. Another cause of discomfort for people with IBS results from oversensitive nerve endings in the digestive tract. Small bubbles of gas that wouldn't bother most people might be quite painful for you. Your heightened sensitivity can also lead to swelling and bloating. When to see a doctor See a healthcare professional if you have a persistent change in bowel habits or other symptoms of IBS . They may mean a more serious condition, such as colon cancer. More-serious symptoms include: Weight loss. Diarrhea at night. Rectal bleeding. Iron deficiency anemia. Unexplained vomiting. Pain that isn't relieved by passing gas or stool. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Low blood pressure (hypotension),"Low blood pressure symptoms can include: Blurred or fading vision. Dizzy or lightheaded feelings. Fainting. Fatigue. Trouble concentrating. Upset stomach. For some people, low blood pressure may be a symptom of an underlying health condition. That's especially so when blood pressure drops suddenly or when low blood pressure occurs with symptoms. A sudden fall in blood pressure can be dangerous. A change of just 20 mm Hg can make you feel dizzy or faint. For example, those symptoms could happen after a drop in systolic pressure from 110 mm Hg to 90 mm Hg. And big drops can be life-threatening. These can happen for reasons such as serious bleeding, serious infections or allergic reactions. Extreme low blood pressure can lead to a condition known as shock. Symptoms of shock include: Confusion, especially in older people. Cold, clammy skin. Decrease in skin color, also called pallor. Rapid, shallow breathing. Weak and rapid pulse. When to see a doctor If you have symptoms of extreme low blood pressure or shock, call 911 or your local emergency number. Most healthcare professionals consider blood pressure to be too low only if it causes symptoms. Minor dizzy or lightheaded feelings from time to time can be caused by many things. Causes could include spending too much time in the sun or in a hot tub. It's important to see a healthcare professional to find out the cause of your symptoms. If you often have low blood pressure readings but feel fine, you might not need treatment. Instead, your healthcare professional tracks your health during routine checkups. It can help to keep a record of your symptoms, when they occur and what you're doing at the time. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Hypospadias,"In hypospadias, the opening of the urethra is on the underside of the penis instead of at the tip. In most cases, the opening of the urethra is within the head of the penis. Less often, the opening is at the middle or the base of the penis. Rarely, the opening is in or beneath the scrotum. Symptoms of hypospadias may include: Opening of the urethra at a place other than the tip of the penis. Downward curve of the penis. This condition is called chordee. Hooded appearance of the penis because only the top half of the penis is covered by foreskin. Differences in spraying when passing urine. When to see a doctor Most babies with hypospadias are diagnosed soon after birth while still in the hospital. But it may be harder to identify hypospadias if there's only a slight change in where the urethral opening is. Talk with your doctor or other healthcare professional if you have concerns about the look of your child's penis or if your child has problems passing urine.

Hypopituitarism,"The symptoms of hypopituitarism usually start slowly and get worse over time. They might not be noticed for months or even years. But for some people, symptoms start suddenly. Symptoms of hypopituitarism vary from person to person. Symptoms depend on what hormones are missing and how little of the hormone is being made. There might be more than one hormone that's low. A second hormone deficiency might increase the symptoms of the first one. Or sometimes, it might hide those symptoms. Growth hormone (GH) deficiency In children, GH deficiency can cause growth problems and short stature. Most adults who have GH deficiency don't have symptoms. But some adults have: Fatigue. Muscle weakness. Changes in body fat. Loss of interest in activities. Lack of social contacts. Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) deficiency A lack of these hormones, called gonadotropins, affects the reproductive system. The lack of hormones keeps the ovaries from making enough eggs and estrogen. It keeps the testicles from making enough sperm and testosterone. This can lower sex drive and cause tiredness. It also can make it hard or impossible to have children — a condition called infertility. In children, the physical changes to an adult body, known as puberty, may not occur or may be late.

Hydrocele,"Often the only sign of a hydrocele is a painless swelling of one or both testicles. The swelling might make an adult's scrotum feel heavy. In general, pain gets worse as the swelling increases. Sometimes, the swollen area might be smaller in the morning and larger later in the day. When to see a doctor See your health care provider if you or your child has swelling of the scrotum. It's important to find out if there are other causes of the swelling that could be treated.

Henoch-Schonlein purpura,
Hemorrhoids,"Symptoms of hemorrhoids usually depend on the type of hemorrhoid. Internal hemorrhoids Internal hemorrhoids lie inside the rectum. You usually can't see or feel them, and they rarely cause discomfort. But straining or irritation when passing stool can cause: Painless bleeding during bowel movements. You might notice small amounts of bright red blood on your toilet tissue or in the toilet. A hemorrhoid to push through the anal opening, called a prolapsed or protruding hemorrhoid. This may result in pain and irritation. External hemorrhoids These are under the skin around the anus. Symptoms might include: Itching or irritation in the anal region. Pain or discomfort. Swelling around the anus. Bleeding. Thrombosed hemorrhoids Blood can pool in an external hemorrhoid and form a clot, called a thrombus. A thrombosed hemorrhoid can result in: Severe pain. Swelling. Inflammation. A hard, discolored lump near the anus. When to see a doctor If you have bleeding during bowel movements or you have hemorrhoids that don't improve after a week of home care, talk to your health care provider. Don't assume rectal bleeding is due to hemorrhoids, especially if you have changes in bowel habits or if your stools change in color or consistency. Rectal bleeding can happen with other diseases, including colorectal cancer and anal cancer. Seek emergency care if you have large amounts of rectal bleeding, lightheadedness, dizziness or faintness.

Hemophilia,"Signs and symptoms of hemophilia vary, depending on your level of clotting factors. If your clotting-factor level is mildly reduced, you might bleed only after surgery or trauma. If your deficiency is severe, you can bleed easily for seemingly no reason. Signs and symptoms of spontaneous bleeding include: Unexplained and excessive bleeding from cuts or injuries, or after surgery or dental work Many large or deep bruises Unusual bleeding after vaccinations Pain, swelling or tightness in your joints Blood in your urine or stool Nosebleeds without a known cause In infants, unexplained irritability Bleeding into the brain A simple bump on the head can cause bleeding into the brain for some people who have severe hemophilia. This rarely happens, but it's one of the most serious complications that can occur. Signs and symptoms include: Painful, prolonged headache Repeated vomiting Sleepiness or lethargy Double vision Sudden weakness or clumsiness Convulsions or seizures When to see a doctor Seek emergency care if you or your child has: Signs or symptoms of bleeding into the brain An injury in which the bleeding won't stop Swollen joints that are hot to the touch and painful to bend Request an appointment"
Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS),"The symptoms of hemolytic uremic syndrome vary, depending on the cause. The first symptoms of hemolytic uremic syndrome caused by E. coli bacteria might include: Diarrhea, which is often bloody. Pain, cramping or bloating in the stomach area. Fever. Vomiting. All forms of hemolytic uremic syndrome damage blood vessels. This damage causes red blood cells to break down, called anemia. The condition also causes blood clots to form in the blood vessels and, in turn, damage the kidneys. Symptoms of these changes include: Loss of color in the skin. Extreme tiredness. Easy bruising. Unusual bleeding, such as bleeding from the nose and mouth. Decreased urinating or blood in the urine. Swelling, called edema, of the legs, feet or ankles. Swelling occurs less often in the face, hands, feet or entire body. Confusion, seizures or stroke. High blood pressure. When to see a doctor See a member of your health care team right away if you or your child has bloody diarrhea or several days of diarrhea followed by: Urinating less. Swelling. Bruising. Unusual bleeding. Extreme tiredness. Seek emergency care if you or your child doesn't urinate for 12 hours or more. Request an appointment"

Weakness. Diabetes. Loss of sex drive. Impotence. Heart failure. Liver failure. Bronze or gray skin color. Memory fog. When symptoms typically appear The most common type of hemochromatosis is present at birth. But most people don't experience symptoms until later in life — usually after age 40 in men and after age 60 in women. Women are more likely to develop symptoms after menopause, when they no longer lose iron with menstruation and pregnancy. When to see a doctor See a healthcare professional if you experience any of the symptoms of hemochromatosis. If you have an immediate family member who has hemochromatosis, ask your healthcare team about genetic testing. Genetic testing can check if you have the gene that increases your risk of hemochromatosis. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Hemifacial spasm,"Common symptoms of hemifacial spasm include jerking of muscles in the face that are most often: On one side of the face. Not controllable. Painless. These muscle movements, also called contractions, often start in the eyelid. Then they might move on to the cheek and mouth on the same side of the face. At first, hemifacial spasms come and go. But over months to years, they occur almost all the time. Sometimes, hemifacial spasms occur on both sides of the face. However, the twitching doesn't occur on both sides of the face at the same time."
Intracranial hematoma,"Symptoms of an intracranial hematoma may develop right after a head injury, or they may take weeks or longer to appear. There may be a period of time without symptoms after a head injury. This is called the lucid interval. Over time, pressure on the brain increases, producing some or all of the following symptoms: Headache that gets worse. Vomiting. Drowsiness and gradual loss of consciousness. Dizziness. Confusion. Pupils that are different sizes. Slurred speech. Loss of movement, known as paralysis, on the opposite side of the body from the head injury. As more blood fills the brain or the narrow space between the brain and skull, other symptoms may appear, such as: Feeling very sleepy or sluggish. Seizures. Loss of consciousness. When to see a doctor An intracranial hematoma can be life-threatening and needs emergency treatment. Seek immediate medical attention after a blow to the head if you or someone you know experiences: Loss of consciousness. A headache that doesn't go away. Vomiting, weakness, blurred vision, trouble staying steady. If you don't notice symptoms right after a hit to the head, watch for physical, mental and emotional changes. For example, if someone seems fine after a head injury and can talk but later becomes unconscious, seek immediate medical care. And even if you feel fine, ask someone to watch you. Memory loss after a blow to your head can make you forget about the blow. Someone you tell might be more likely to recognize the warning signs and get you medical attention. Request an appointment"
Liver hemangioma,
Hemangioma,"A hemangioma may be visible at birth, but it appears more often during the first month of life. It starts as a flat red mark on the body, most often on the face, scalp, chest or back. A child generally only has one mark, but some children may have more than one mark. During your child's first year, the red mark may grow rapidly into a spongy, rubbery-looking bump that sticks out from the skin. The hemangioma then enters a rest phase. Then it will begin to slowly go away. Many hemangiomas go away by age 5, and most go away by age 10. The skin may be slightly discolored or raised after the hemangioma goes away. When to see a doctor Your child's health care provider will check the hemangioma during routine visits. Contact your child's health care provider if the hemangioma bleeds, forms a sore or looks infected. Seek medical care if the condition causes problems with an important bodily function, such as your child's vision, breathing, hearing or ability to go to the bathroom. Request an appointment"

Signs and symptoms may include: Being preoccupied with having or getting a serious disease or health condition Worrying that minor symptoms or body sensations mean you have a serious illness Being easily alarmed about your health status Finding little or no reassurance from doctor visits or negative test results Worrying excessively about a specific medical condition or your risk of developing a medical condition because it runs in your family Having so much distress about possible illnesses that it's hard for you to function Repeatedly checking your body for signs of illness or disease Frequently making medical appointments for reassurance — or avoiding medical care for fear of being diagnosed with a serious illness Avoiding people, places or activities for fear of health risks Constantly talking about your health and possible illnesses Frequently searching the internet for causes of symptoms or possible illnesses When to see a doctor Because symptoms can be related to health problems, it's important to be evaluated by your primary care provider if this hasn't already been done.

Tension headache,"Symptoms of a tension-type headache include: Dull, aching head pain. Feeling of tightness or pressure across the forehead or on the sides and back of the head. Tenderness in the scalp, neck and shoulder muscles. Tension-type headaches are divided into two main categories — episodic and chronic. Episodic tension-type headaches Episodic tension-type headaches can last from 30 minutes to a week. Frequent episodic tension-type headaches occur less than 15 days a month for at least three months. This type of headache can become chronic. Chronic tension-type headaches This type of tension-type headache lasts hours and may be constant. Chronic tension-type headaches occur 15 or more days a month for at least three months. Tension-type headaches versus migraines Tension-type headaches can be hard to tell apart from migraines. And if you have frequent episodic tension-type headaches, you also can have migraines. But unlike some forms of migraine, tension-type headaches usually aren't associated with visual disturbances such as seeing bright spots or flashes of light. People with tension-type headaches also don't usually experience nausea or vomiting with head pain. While physical activity tends to make migraine pain worse, it doesn't affect tension-type headache pain. Sometimes a tension-type headache occurs with sensitivity to light or sound, but this symptom isn't common. When to see a doctor Make an appointment with a health care professional See your health care professional if you need to take medicine for tension-type headaches more than twice a week. Also make an appointment if tension-type headaches disrupt your life. Even if you have a history of headaches, see your health care professional if the headache pattern changes. Also see your care professional if your headaches suddenly feel different. Occasionally, headaches may be caused by a serious medical condition. These can include a brain tumor or rupture of a weakened blood vessel, known as an aneurysm. When to seek emergency help Get emergency care if you have any of these symptoms: A sudden, very bad headache. Headache with a fever, stiff neck, mental confusion, seizures, double vision, weakness, numbness or trouble speaking. Headache after a head injury, especially if the headache gets worse.

Sensitivity to light, sound, and sometimes smell and touch. Nausea and vomiting. Post-drome After a migraine attack, you might feel drained, confused and washed out for up to a day. Some people report feeling elated. Sudden head movement might bring on the pain again briefly. When to see a doctor Migraines are often undiagnosed and untreated. If you regularly have signs and symptoms of migraine, keep a record of your attacks and how you treated them. Then make an appointment with your health care provider to discuss your headaches.

When there are symptoms in this phase, they may include jaundice, fatigue, nausea, fever and muscle aches. Long-term infection with the hepatitis C virus is called chronic hepatitis C. Chronic hepatitis C usually has no symptoms for many years. Symptoms appear only after the virus damages the liver enough to cause them. Symptoms can include: Bleeding easily. Bruising easily. Fatigue. Not wanting to eat. Yellowing of the skin, called jaundice. This might show up more in white people. Also, yellowing of the whites of the eyes in white, Black and brown people. Dark-colored urine. Itchy skin. Fluid buildup in the stomach area, called ascites. Swelling in the legs. Weight loss. Confusion, drowsiness and slurred speech, called hepatic encephalopathy. Spiderlike blood vessels on the skin, called spider angiomas. Acute hepatitis C infection doesn't always become chronic. Some people clear the infection from their bodies after the acute phase. This is called spontaneous viral clearance. Antiviral therapy also helps clear acute hepatitis C. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Irregular breathing — a gap of more than 10 seconds between breaths. Damp or sweaty skin. Blue or gray skin color due to low oxygen levels. Depending on skin color, these changes may be harder to see. Slow heart rate. Low body temperature. Difficulty remaining conscious. Passing out and not being able to be awakened. A person who can't be awakened is at risk of dying. If you suspect that someone has alcohol poisoning — even if you don't see the classic symptoms — get medical help right away.

Gender dysphoria,"Gender identity is having the internal sense of being male or female or being somewhere along the gender spectrum, or having an internal sense of gender that is beyond male and female. People who have gender dysphoria feel a big difference between their gender identity and their sex assigned at birth. Gender dysphoria is different from simply not following stereotypical gender behaviors. It involves feelings of distress due to a strong, lasting desire to be another gender. Gender dysphoria might start in childhood and continue into the teen years and adulthood. But some people may have periods of time in which they don't notice gender dysphoria. Or the feelings may seem to come and go. Some people have gender dysphoria when puberty starts. In others, it may not develop until later in life. Some teens might express their feelings of gender dysphoria to their parents or a healthcare professional. But others might have symptoms of a mood disorder, anxiety or depression instead. Or they might have social difficulties or problems in school."

Most people who have Gaucher disease have varying degrees of the following problems: Abdominal complaints.

Gaucher disease can weaken bone, increasing the risk of painful fractures. It can also interfere with the blood supply to your bones, which can cause portions of the bone to die. Blood disorders. A decrease in healthy red blood cells (anemia) can result in severe fatigue. Gaucher disease also affects the cells responsible for clotting, which can cause easy bruising and nosebleeds. More rarely, Gaucher disease affects the brain, which can cause abnormal eye movements, muscle rigidity, swallowing difficulties and seizures. One rare subtype of Gaucher disease begins in infancy and typically results in death by 2 years of age.

Frostbite is most common on the fingers, toes, ears, cheeks, penis, chin and tip of the nose. Because of numbness, you may not notice you have frostbite until someone points it out. Changes in the color of the affected area might be difficult to see on brown and Black skin. Frostbite occurs in several stages: Frostnip. Frostnip is the early stage of frostbite. Symptoms are pain, tingling and numbness. Frostnip doesn't cause permanent damage to the skin. Mild to moderate frostbite. Frostbite causes slight changes in skin color. The skin may begin to feel warm. This is a sign of serious skin involvement. If you treat frostbite with rewarming at this stage, the surface of the skin may look patchy. The affected area may sting, burn and swell. A fluid-filled blister may form 12 to 36 hours after rewarming. This stage also is called superficial frostbite. Deep frostbite. As frostbite progresses, it affects all layers of the skin and the tissues below. The affected skin turns white or blue-gray. Large blood blisters may appear 24 to 48 hours after rewarming. Weeks after the injury, tissue may turn black and hard as it dies. When to see a doctor Other than frostnip, frostbite injuries need to be checked by a healthcare professional to find out how serious they are. Seek emergency care for: Intense pain even after taking a pain reliever and rewarming. Intense shivering. Slurred speech. Drowsiness. Trouble walking. People with frostbite also might have hypothermia. Shivering, slurred speech, and being sleepy or clumsy are symptoms of hypothermia. In babies, symptoms are cold skin, a change in skin color and very low energy. Hypothermia is a serious condition in which the body loses heat faster than it can be produced. What you can do in the meantime While you wait for emergency medical help or an appointment with a healthcare professional, take these steps as needed: Get out of the cold and remove wet clothing. If you suspect hypothermia, wrap up in a warm blanket until help arrives. Protect the injured area from further damage. Don't walk on frostbitten feet or toes if possible.

Fever,
Fetal macrosomia,
Fetal alcohol syndrome,"The severity of fetal alcohol syndrome symptoms varies. Some children have far greater problems than others do. Symptoms of fetal alcohol syndrome may include any mix of issues with how the body develops; thinking, learning and behavior; and functioning and coping in daily life. Physical development issues How the body develops may include: Facial features that are typical of fetal alcohol syndrome. These may include small eyes, a very thin upper lip, a flat nose bridge, and a smooth skin surface between the nose and upper lip. Slow physical growth before and after birth. Delayed development, including taking longer to reach milestones, such as sitting, talking and walking. Vision or hearing problems. Smaller than average head and brain size. Changes with how the heart, kidneys and bones develop. Poor coordination or balance. Being jittery or hyperactive. Learning and thinking issues Learning and thinking may include: Intellectual disability and learning disorders, including trouble with memory, learning new things, focusing and thinking. Not understanding the results of choices made. Poor judgment skills, such as having a hard time thinking through issues, problem-solving, reasoning and making decisions that affect everyday life. Short attention span that affects staying with a task and finishing. Poor concept of time, that impacts following schedules, knowing what time to leave in order to arrive on time and understanding how long a task will take. Trouble with organizing and planning or working toward a goal, including trouble understanding and following directions. Social and behavioral issues Functioning in everyday life, coping and interacting with others may include: Challenges in school with attendance, learning, behavior and interacting with others. Trouble getting along with others, including struggling with communication and social skills. Trouble adapting to change or switching from one task to another. Issues with behavior and with controlling emotions and actions. Problems managing life skills, such as telling time, self care, managing money and staying safe. Being easily influenced by others or taken advantage of. Quickly changing moods. When to see a doctor If you are pregnant and can't stop drinking alcohol, ask your obstetrician, primary care doctor or other healthcare professional for help. You also may choose to talk to a mental health professional. A social worker can direct you to community programs that offer help, for example, Alcoholics Anonymous. Because early diagnosis may help lessen the risk of some challenges for children with fetal alcohol syndrome, let your child's healthcare professional know if you drank alcohol while you were pregnant. Don't wait for your child to have issues before seeking help. If you adopted a child or are providing foster care, you may not know if the biological mother drank alcohol while pregnant. International adoption from some countries may have a higher rate of alcohol use by pregnant mothers. If you have concerns about your child's learning or behavior, talk with your child's healthcare professional to find out what might be causing these problems.

Female infertility,
Fuchs dystrophy,"As Fuchs dystrophy gets worse, symptoms often affect both eyes. Symptoms may include: Blurred or cloudy vision, sometimes described as a lack of clear vision. Changes in vision throughout the day. Symptoms are worse in the morning when you wake up and slowly get better during the day. As the disease gets worse, blurred vision may take longer to get better or does not get better at all. Glare, which can decrease your vision in dim and bright light. Seeing halos around lights. Pain or grittiness from tiny blisters on the surface of your cornea. When to see a doctor If you have some of these symptoms, and especially if they get worse over time, see an eye care professional. The eye care professional may refer you to a corneal specialist. If symptoms develop suddenly, call for an urgent appointment. Other eye conditions that cause the same symptoms as Fuchs dystrophy also require treatment right away. Request an appointment"
Febrile seizure,
Farsightedness,"Farsightedness may mean: Nearby objects may appear blurry You need to squint to see clearly You have eyestrain, including burning eyes, and aching in or around the eyes You have general eye discomfort or a headache after doing close tasks, such as reading, writing, computer work or drawing, for a time When to see a doctor If your degree of farsightedness is pronounced enough that you can't perform a task as well as you wish, or if your quality of vision detracts from your enjoyment of activities, see an eye doctor. He or she can determine the degree of your farsightedness and advise you of options to correct your vision. Since it may not always be readily apparent that you're having trouble with your vision, the American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends the following intervals for regular eye exams: Adults If you're at high risk of certain eye diseases, such as glaucoma, get a dilated eye exam every one to two years, starting at age 40. If you don't wear glasses or contacts, have no symptoms of eye trouble, and are at a low risk of developing eye diseases, such as glaucoma, get an eye exam at the following intervals: An initial exam at 40 Every two to four years between ages 40 and 54 Every one to three years between ages 55 and 64 Every one to two years beginning at age 65 If you wear glasses or contacts or you have a health condition that affects the eyes, such as diabetes, you'll likely need to have your eyes checked regularly. Ask your eye doctor how frequently you need to schedule your appointments. But, if you notice problems with your vision, schedule an appointment with your eye doctor as soon as possible, even if you've recently had an eye exam. Blurred vision, for example, may suggest you need a prescription change, or it could be a sign of another problem. Children and adolescents Children need to be screened for eye disease and have their vision tested by a pediatrician, an ophthalmologist, an optometrist or another trained screener at the following ages and intervals. Age 6 months Age 3 years Before first grade and every two years during school years, at well-child visits, or through school or public screenings Request an appointment"
Familial Mediterranean fever,
Familial hypercholesterolemia,
Familial adenomatous polyposis,"The main sign of FAP is hundreds or even thousands of polyps growing in your colon and rectum, usually starting by your mid-teens. The polyps are nearly 100 percent certain to develop into colon cancer or rectal cancer by the time you're in your 40s."
Tetralogy of Fallot,"Tetralogy of Fallot symptoms depend on how much blood flow is blocked from leaving the heart to go to the lungs. Symptoms may include: Blue or gray skin color. Shortness of breath and rapid breathing, especially during feeding or exercise. Trouble gaining weight. Getting tired easily during play or exercise. Irritability. Crying for long periods of time. Fainting. Tet spells Some babies with tetralogy of Fallot suddenly develop deep blue or gray skin, nails, and lips. This usually happens when the baby cries, eats or is upset. These episodes are called tet spells. Tet spells are caused by a rapid drop in the amount of oxygen in the blood. They are most common in young infants, around 2 to 4 months old. Tet spells may be less noticeable in toddlers and older children. That's because they typically squat when they're short of breath. Squatting sends more blood to the lungs. When to see a doctor Serious congenital heart defects are often diagnosed before or soon after your child is born. Seek medical help if you notice that your baby has these symptoms: Trouble breathing. Bluish color of the skin. Lack of alertness. Seizures. Weakness. More irritable than usual. If your baby becomes blue or gray, place your baby on the side and pull the baby's knees up to the chest. This helps increase blood flow to the lungs. Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Request an appointment"
Flatfeet,"Most people have no symptoms associated with flatfeet. But some people with flatfeet experience foot pain, particularly in the heel or arch area. Pain may worsen with activity. Swelling may occur along the inside of the ankle. When to see a doctor Talk to your health care provider if you or your child has foot pain, particularly if it is limiting what you want to do. Request an appointment"
Factor V Leiden,"The factor V Leiden mutation does not itself cause any symptoms. Since factor V Leiden is a risk for developing blood clots in the leg or lungs, the first indication that you have the disorder may be the development of an abnormal blood clot. Some clots do no damage and disappear on their own. Others can be life-threatening. Symptoms of a blood clot depend on what part of your body is affected. A clot in a deep vein This is known as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which most commonly occurs in the legs. A DVT may not cause any symptoms. If signs and symptoms do occur, they can include: Pain Swelling Redness Warmth A clot that travels to your lungs Known as a pulmonary embolism, this occurs when a portion of a DVT breaks free and travels through the right side of your heart to your lung, where it blocks blood flow. This can be a life-threatening situation. Signs and symptoms may include: Sudden shortness of breath Chest pain when breathing in A cough that produces bloody or blood-streaked sputum Rapid heartbeat When to see a doctor Seek medical attention immediately if you have signs or symptoms of either a DVT or a pulmonary embolism. Request an appointment"
Factitious disorder,"Factitious disorder symptoms involve people trying to look ill, making themselves ill or hurting themselves. They also may fake symptoms, make symptoms seem worse than they are or pretend they can't do certain things because of their symptoms so they can deceive others. People with the condition work hard to hide their lies. It may be hard to know that their symptoms are part of a serious mental health condition. People with this condition continue with the lies, even without any benefit or reward, or when faced with evidence that doesn't support their claims. Factitious disorder symptoms may include: Clever and convincing medical or mental health problems. Deep knowledge of medical terms and diseases. Vague symptoms or symptoms that aren't consistent. Conditions that get worse for no clear reason. Conditions that don't respond as expected to standard treatments. Seeking treatment from many healthcare professionals or hospitals, which may include using a fake name. Not wanting healthcare professionals to talk to family or friends or other healthcare professionals. Staying in the hospital a lot. Desire for frequent testing or risky surgeries and procedures. Many surgical scars or evidence of many procedures. Having few visitors when in the hospital. Arguing with healthcare professionals and staff. Factious disorder imposed on another Factitious disorder imposed on another, previously called Munchausen syndrome by proxy, is when someone falsely claims that another person has physical or mental symptoms of illness or causes injury or disease in another person to deceive others. People with this condition present another person as sick, hurt or having a hard time functioning, claiming they need medical help. Usually this involves a parent harming a child. This form of abuse can put a child in danger of being hurt or getting medical care that isn't needed. How those with factitious disorder fake illness Because people with factitious disorder become experts at faking symptoms and diseases or hurting themselves, it may be hard for healthcare professionals and loved ones to know whether symptoms and illnesses are real. People with factitious disorder make up symptoms or cause illnesses in several ways. For example, they may: Make symptoms seem worse than they are. Even when there is an actual medical or mental health condition, they may exaggerate symptoms. They may try to look sicker or make themselves look like they're having a harder time functioning than they actually are. Make up histories. They may give loved ones, healthcare professionals or support groups false medical histories, such as claiming to have had cancer or AIDS . Or they may create false health records to make it look like they're ill. Fake symptoms. They may fake symptoms, such as stomach pain, seizures or passing out. Hurt themselves. They may make themselves sick. For example, they may inject themselves with bacteria, milk, gasoline or feces. They may hurt, cut or burn themselves. They may take medicines, such as blood thinners or medicines for diabetes, to mimic diseases. They also may hinder wound healing, such as by reopening or infecting cuts. Tamper. They may tamper with medical instruments so results aren't correct. For example, they may heat up thermometers. Or they may tamper with lab tests, such as spoiling their urine samples with blood or other substances. When to see a doctor People with factitious disorder may know the risk of injury or even death when they hurt themselves or seek treatment that's not needed. But they have a hard time managing their behaviors. They also aren't likely to seek help. Even when they see proof that they're causing their illness, such as a video, they often deny it and refuse mental health help. If you think that a loved one may be exaggerating or faking health problems, it may help to try to talk to that person about your concerns. Try not to be angry or to judge or confront the person. Also try to reinforce and urge healthier, more productive activities rather than focus on beliefs and behaviors that aren't healthy. Offer support and care. If possible, help find treatment for the person. If your loved one causes self-harm or attempts suicide, contact a suicide hotline. In the U.S., call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline , available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Or use the Lifeline Chat . Services are free and confidential. The Suicide & Crisis Lifeline in the U.S. has a Spanish language phone line at 1-888-628-9454 (toll-free). If you suspect that a child is being harmed or abused by a caregiver as part of factitious disorder, you can contact the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline at 1-800-422-4453 (toll-free). This hotline is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. There also may be local and state child protective services agencies in your area. Request an appointment"
Eye floaters,"Symptoms of eye floaters may include: Small shapes in your vision that appear as dark specks or knobby, transparent strings of floating material Spots that move when you move your eyes, so when you try to look at them, they move quickly out of your line of vision Spots that are most noticeable when you look at a plain bright background, such as a blue sky or a white wall Small shapes or strings that eventually settle down and drift out of the line of vision When to see a doctor Contact an eye specialist immediately if you notice: Many more eye floaters than usual A sudden onset of new floaters Flashes of light in the same eye as the floaters A gray curtain or blurry area that blocks part of your vision Darkness on a side or sides of your vision (peripheral vision loss) These painless symptoms could be caused by a retinal tear, with or without a retinal detachment. This is a sight-threatening condition that requires immediate attention. Mayo Clinic Minute: What are eye floaters? Show transcript for video Mayo Clinic Minute: What are eye floaters? Jason Howland: Having vision problems? Do you see black or gray specks, strings or cobwebs that drift about when you move your eyes? It could be eye floaters. Amir Khan, M.D., Consultant, Ophthalmology, Mayo Clinic: In the back of our eyes, we have a substance called ""the vitreous."" When we're young, it's a firm clump of jelly. As we age, this firm clump of jelly can liquefy and break up into smaller pieces. Those smaller pieces are what you may notice as floater. Mr. Howland: Eye floaters are more common as you get older and if you're nearsighted. The biggest concern – they can cause retinal tears. Dr. Khan: If a tear develops in the retina, fluid can get in underneath that tear and just lift the retina off like wallpaper off a wall and that's a retinal detachment. Mr. Howland: And that can cause blindness, which is why it's especially important to have a dilated eye exam within days of noticing new floaters or changes in vision. Most eye floaters don't require treatment, but your eye doctor likely will recommend regular eye exams to ensure the condition doesn't worsen. For the Mayo Clinic Newsnetwork, I'm Jason Howland.

Epilepsy,"Seizure symptoms vary depending on the type of seizure. Because epilepsy is caused by certain activity in the brain, seizures can affect any brain process. Seizure symptoms may include: Temporary confusion. A staring spell. Stiff muscles. Uncontrollable jerking movements of the arms and legs. Loss of consciousness. Psychological symptoms such as fear, anxiety or deja vu. Sometimes people with epilepsy may have changes in their behavior. They also may have symptoms of psychosis. Most people with epilepsy tend to have the same type of seizure each time. Symptoms are usually similar from episode to episode. Warning signs of seizures Some people with focal seizures have warning signs in the moments before a seizure begins. These warning signs are known as aura. Warning signs might include a feeling in the stomach. Or they might include emotions such as fear. Some people might feel deja vu. Auras also might be a taste or a smell. They might even be visual, such as a steady or flashing light, a color, or a shape. Some people may experience dizziness and loss of balance. And some people may see things that aren't there, known as hallucinations. Seizures are classified as either focal or generalized, based on how and where the brain activity causing the seizure begins. When seizures appear to result from activity in just one area of the brain, they're called focal seizures. These seizures fall into two categories: Focal seizures without loss of consciousness. Once called simple partial seizures, these seizures don't cause a loss of awareness, also known as consciousness. They may alter emotions or change the way things look, smell, feel, taste or sound. Some people experience deja vu. This type of seizure also may result in involuntary jerking of a body part, such as an arm or a leg. And focal seizures may cause sensory symptoms such as tingling, dizziness and flashing lights. Focal seizures with impaired awareness. Once called complex partial seizures, these seizures involve a change or loss of consciousness. This type of seizure may seem like being in a dream. During a focal seizure with impaired awareness, people may stare into space and not respond in typical ways to the environment. They also may perform repetitive movements, such as hand rubbing, chewing, swallowing or walking in circles. Symptoms of focal seizures may be confused with other neurological conditions, such as migraine, narcolepsy or mental illness. A thorough exam and testing are needed to tell if symptoms are the result of epilepsy or another condition. Focal seizures may come from any lobe of the brain. Some types of focal seizures include: Temporal lobe seizures. Temporal lobe seizures begin in the areas of the brain called the temporal lobes. The temporal lobes process emotions and play a role in short-term memory. People who have these seizures often experience an aura. The aura may include sudden emotion such as fear or joy. It also may be a sudden taste or smell. Or an aura may be a feeling of deja vu, or a rising sensation in the stomach. During the seizure, people may lose awareness of their surroundings. They also may stare into space, smack their lips, swallow or chew repeatedly, or have movements of their fingers. Frontal lobe seizures. Frontal lobe seizures begin in the front of the brain. This is the part of the brain that controls movement. Frontal lobe seizures cause people to move their heads and eyes to one side. They won't respond when spoken to and may scream or laugh. They might extend one arm and flex the other arm. They also might make repetitive movements such as rocking or bicycle pedaling. Occipital lobe seizures. These seizures begin in the area of the brain called the occipital lobe. This lobe affects vision and how people see. People who have this type of seizure may have hallucinations. Or they may lose some or all of their vision during the seizure. These seizures also might cause eye blinking or make the eyes move. Generalized seizures Seizures that appear to involve all areas of the brain are called generalized seizures. Generalized seizures include: Absence seizures. Absence seizures, previously known as petit mal seizures, typically occur in children. Symptoms include staring into space with or without subtle body movements. Movements may include eye blinking or lip smacking and only last 5 to 10 seconds. These seizures may occur in clusters, happening as often as 100 times a day, and cause a brief loss of awareness. Tonic seizures. Tonic seizures cause stiff muscles and may affect consciousness. These seizures usually affect muscles in the back, arms and legs and may cause the person to fall to the ground. Atonic seizures. Atonic seizures, also known as drop seizures, cause a loss of muscle control. Since this most often affects the legs, it often causes sudden falls to the ground. Clonic seizures. Clonic seizures are associated with repeated or rhythmic jerking muscle movements. These seizures usually affect the neck, face and arms. Myoclonic seizures. Myoclonic seizures usually appear as sudden brief jerks or twitches and usually affect the upper body, arms and legs. Tonic-clonic seizures. Tonic-clonic seizures, previously known as grand mal seizures, are the most dramatic type of epileptic seizure. They can cause a sudden loss of consciousness and body stiffening, twitching and shaking. They sometimes cause loss of bladder control or biting of the tongue. When to see a doctor Seek immediate medical help if any of the following occurs with a seizure: The seizure lasts more than five minutes. Breathing or consciousness doesn't return after the seizure stops. A second seizure follows immediately. You have a high fever. You're pregnant. You have diabetes. You've injured yourself during the seizure. You continue to have seizures even though you've been taking anti-seizure medicine. If you have a seizure for the first time, seek medical advice.

Endometriosis,"The main symptom of endometriosis is pelvic pain. It's often linked with menstrual periods. Although many people have cramping during their periods, those with endometriosis often describe menstrual pain that's far worse than usual. The pain also may become worse over time. Common symptoms of endometriosis include: Painful periods. Pelvic pain and cramping may start before a menstrual period and last for days into it. You also may have lower back and stomach pain. Another name for painful periods is dysmenorrhea. Pain with sex. Pain during or after sex is common with endometriosis. Pain with bowel movements or urination. You're most likely to have these symptoms before or during a menstrual period. Excessive bleeding. Sometimes, you may have heavy menstrual periods or bleeding between periods. Infertility. For some people, endometriosis is first found during tests for infertility treatment. Other symptoms. You may have fatigue, diarrhea, constipation, bloating or nausea. These symptoms are more common before or during menstrual periods. The seriousness of your pain may not be a sign of the number or extent of endometriosis growths in your body. You could have a small amount of tissue with bad pain. Or you could have lots of endometriosis tissue with little or no pain. Still, some people with endometriosis have no symptoms. Often, they find out they have the condition when they can't get pregnant or after they get surgery for another reason. For those with symptoms, endometriosis sometimes may seem like other conditions that can cause pelvic pain. These include pelvic inflammatory disease or ovarian cysts. Or it may be confused with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which causes bouts of diarrhea, constipation and stomach cramps. IBS also can happen along with endometriosis. This makes it harder for your health care team to find the exact cause of your symptoms. When to see a doctor See a member of your health care team if you think you might have symptoms of endometriosis. Endometriosis can be a challenge to manage. You may be better able to take charge of the symptoms if: Your care team finds the disease sooner rather than later. You learn as much as you can about endometriosis. You get treatment from a team of health care professionals from different medical fields, if needed. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Emphysema,"You can have emphysema for many years without noticing any symptoms. They usually begin gradually and include: Shortness of breath, especially with physical activity. This is the main symptom of emphysema. Wheezing, whistling or squeaking sound when you breathe out. Coughing. Chest tightness or heaviness. Feeling very tired. Weight loss and ankle swelling that may happen as the condition gets worse over time. You may start avoiding activities that cause you to be short of breath, so the symptoms don't become a problem until they keep you from doing daily tasks. Emphysema eventually causes trouble breathing even while you're resting. Emphysema is one of the two common types of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The other common type is chronic bronchitis. In chronic bronchitis, the lining of the tubes that carry air to your lungs, called bronchial tubes, become irritated and swollen. This inflammation limits the space for air to move in and out of the lungs and makes extra mucus that blocks the airways. Emphysema and chronic bronchitis often occur together, so the general term COPD may be used. Exacerbations Even with ongoing treatment, you may have times when symptoms become worse for days or weeks. This is called an acute exacerbation (eg-zas-er-bay-shun). It may lead to lung failure if you don't receive prompt treatment. Exacerbations may be caused by a respiratory infection, air pollution or other things that trigger inflammation. Whatever the cause, it's important to get medical help promptly if you notice an ongoing worsening cough or extra mucus, or if you have a harder time breathing. When to see a doctor See your healthcare professional if you've had shortness of breath you can't explain for several months, especially if it's getting worse or if it's keeping you from doing your daily activities. Don't ignore it or tell yourself it's because you're aging or out of shape. Go to the emergency department at a hospital if: You're having a hard time catching your breath or talking. Your lips or fingernails turn blue or gray with physical activity. Others notice that you're not mentally alert. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,"There are many different types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, but the most common signs and symptoms include: Overly flexible joints. Because the connective tissue that holds joints together is looser, your joints can move far past the normal range of motion. Joint pain and dislocations are common. Stretchy skin. Weakened connective tissue allows your skin to stretch much more than usual. You may be able to pull a pinch of skin up away from your flesh, but it will snap right back into place when you let go. Your skin might also feel exceptionally soft and velvety. Fragile skin. Damaged skin often doesn't heal well. For example, the stitches used to close a wound often will tear out and leave a gaping scar. These scars may look thin and crinkly. Symptom severity can vary from person to person and depends on the specific type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome that you have. The most common type is called hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome People who have vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome often share distinctive facial features of a thin nose, thin upper lip, small earlobes and prominent eyes. They also have thin, translucent skin that bruises very easily. In fair-skinned people, the underlying blood vessels are very visible through the skin. Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome can weaken your heart's largest artery (aorta), as well as the arteries to other regions of your body. A rupture of any of these larger blood vessels can be fatal. The vascular type can also weaken the walls of the uterus or large intestines — which also may rupture."
Pulmonary edema,
Edema,"Edema in foot and ankle Enlarge image Close Edema in foot and ankle Edema in foot and ankle Swelling of the foot, ankle and leg can be bad enough to leave a dimple, also known as a pit, in the skin after pressing on the area. This swelling, called edema, is the result of too much fluid in the tissues. Congestive heart failure or the vein not working well, also known as venous insufficiency, is often the cause. Symptoms of edema include: Swelling or puffiness of the tissue right under the skin, especially in legs or arms. Stretched or shiny skin. Skin that holds a dimple, also known as pitting, after it's been pressed for a few seconds. Swelling of the belly, also called the abdomen, so that it's bigger than usual. Feeling of leg heaviness. When to see a doctor Make an appointment to see a health care provider for swelling, stretched or shiny skin, or skin that holds a dimple after being pressed. See a provider right away for: Shortness of breath. Irregular heartbeat. Chest pain. These can be signs of fluid buildup in the lungs, also known as pulmonary edema. It can be life-threatening and needs quick treatment. After sitting for a long time, such as on a long flight, call your care provider if you get leg pain and swelling that won't go away. Especially if the pain and swelling is on one side, these can be symptoms of a blood clot deep in the vein, also known as deep vein thrombosis, or DVT. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Ectropion,"Normally when you blink, your eyelids distribute tears evenly across your eyes, keeping the surfaces of the eyes lubricated. These tears drain into small openings on the inner part of your eyelids (puncta). If you have ectropion, your lower lid pulls away from your eye and tears don't drain properly into the puncta. The resulting signs and symptoms can include: Watery eyes (excessive tearing). Without proper drainage, your tears may pool and constantly flow over your eyelids. Excessive dryness. Ectropion can cause your eyes to feel dry, gritty and sandy. Irritation. Stagnant tears or dryness can irritate your eyes, causing a burning sensation and redness in your eyelids and the whites of your eyes. Sensitivity to light. Stagnant tears or dry eyes can irritate the surface of the cornea, making you sensitive to light. When to see a doctor See your doctor if your eyes are constantly watering or irritated, or your eyelid seems to be sagging or drooping. Seek immediate care if you have been diagnosed with ectropion and you experience: Rapidly increasing redness in your eyes Sensitivity to light Decreasing vision These are signs and symptoms of cornea exposure or ulcers, which can harm your vision.

Ectopic pregnancy,
Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs),
Ebstein anomaly,"Some babies born with Ebstein anomaly have few or no symptoms. Others have a tricuspid valve that leaks severely and causes more-noticeable symptoms.

Depending on skin color, these color changes may be harder or easier to see. Fatigue. Feeling of a pounding or rapid heartbeat or irregular heartbeats. Shortness of breath, especially with activity.

You may be sent to a doctor trained in heart diseases, called a cardiologist. Request an appointment"
Eating disorders,"Symptoms vary, depending on the type of eating disorder. Anorexia, bulimia and binge-eating disorder are the most common eating disorders. People with eating disorders can have all different body types and sizes. Anorexia Anorexia (an-o-REK-see-uh), also called anorexia nervosa, can be a life-threatening eating disorder. It includes an unhealthy low body weight, intense fear of gaining weight, and a view of weight and shape that is not realistic. Anorexia often involves using extreme efforts to control weight and shape, which often seriously interfere with health and daily life. Anorexia may include severely limiting calories or cutting out certain kinds of foods or food groups. It may involve other methods to lose weight, such as exercising too much, using laxatives or diet aids, or vomiting after eating. Efforts to reduce weight can cause severe health problems, even for those who continue eating throughout the day or whose weight isn't extremely low. Bulimia Bulimia (buh-LEE-me-uh), also called bulimia nervosa, is a serious, sometimes life-threatening eating disorder. Bulimia includes episodes of bingeing, commonly followed by episodes of purging. Sometimes bulimia also includes severely limiting eating for periods of time. This often leads to stronger urges to binge eat and then purge. Bingeing involves eating food — sometimes an extremely large amount — in a short period of time. During bingeing, people feel like they have no control over their eating and that they can't stop. After eating, due to guilt, shame or an intense fear of weight gain, purging is done to get rid of calories. Purging can include vomiting, exercising too much, not eating for a period of time, or using other methods, such as taking laxatives. Some people change medicine doses, such as changing insulin amounts, to try to lose weight. Bulimia also involves being preoccupied with weight and body shape, with severe and harsh self-judgment of personal appearance. Binge-eating disorder Binge-eating disorder involves eating food in a short amount of time. When bingeing, it feels like there's no control over eating. But binge eating is not followed by purging. During a binge, people may eat food faster or eat more food than planned. Even when not hungry, eating may continue long past feeling uncomfortably full. After a binge, people often feel a great deal of guilt, disgust or shame. They may fear gaining weight. They may try to severely limit eating for periods of time. This leads to increased urges to binge, setting up an unhealthy cycle. Embarrassment can lead to eating alone to hide bingeing. A new round of bingeing commonly occurs at least once a week. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder includes extremely limited eating or not eating certain foods. The pattern of eating often doesn't meet minimum daily nutrition needs. This may lead to problems with growth, development and functioning in daily life. But people with this disorder don't have fears about gaining weight or body size. Instead, they may not be interested in eating or may avoid food with a certain color, texture, smell or taste. Or they may worry about what can happen when eating. For example, they may have a fear of choking or vomiting, or they may worry about getting stomach problems. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder can be diagnosed in all ages, but it's more common in younger children. The disorder can result in major weight loss or failure to gain weight in childhood. A lack of proper nutrition can lead to major health problems. When to see a doctor An eating disorder can be difficult to manage or overcome by yourself. The earlier you get treatment, the more likely you'll make a full recovery. Sometimes people can have problem eating behaviors that are similar to some symptoms of an eating disorder, but the symptoms don't meet the guidelines for a diagnosis of an eating disorder. But these problem eating behaviors can still seriously affect health and well-being. If you have problem eating behaviors that cause you distress or affect your life or health, or if you think you have an eating disorder, seek medical help. Urging a loved one to seek treatment Many people with eating disorders may not think they need treatment. One of the main features of many eating disorders is not realizing how severe the symptoms are. Also, guilt and shame often prevent people from getting help. If you're worried about a friend or family member, urge the person to talk to a health care provider. Even if that person isn't ready to admit to having an issue with food, you can start the discussion by expressing concern and a desire to listen. Red flags that may suggest an eating disorder include: Skipping meals or snacks or making excuses for not eating. Having a very limited diet that hasn't been prescribed by a trained medical professional. Too much focus on food or healthy eating, especially if it means not participating in usual events, such as sports banquets, eating birthday cake or dining out. Making own meals rather than eating what the family eats. Withdrawing from usual social activities. Frequent and ongoing worry or complaints about being unhealthy or overweight and talk of losing weight. Frequent checking in the mirror for what are thought to be flaws. Repeatedly eating large amounts of foods. Using dietary supplements, laxatives or herbal products for weight loss. Exercising much more than the average person. This includes not taking rest days or days off for injury or illness or refusing to attend social events or other life events because of wanting to exercise. Calluses on the knuckles from reaching fingers into the mouth to cause vomiting. Problems with loss of tooth enamel that may be a sign of repeated vomiting. Leaving during meals or right after a meal to use the toilet. Talk of depression, disgust, shame or guilt about eating habits. Eating in secret. If you're worried that you or your child may have an eating disorder, contact a health care provider to talk about your concerns. If needed, get a referral to a mental health provider with expertise in eating disorders. Or if your insurance permits it, contact an expert directly. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Dyslexia,"Signs of dyslexia can be difficult to recognize before your child enters school, but some early clues may indicate a problem. Once your child reaches school age, your child's teacher may be the first to notice a problem. Severity varies, but the condition often becomes apparent as a child starts learning to read. Before school Signs that a young child may be at risk of dyslexia include: Late talking Learning new words slowly Problems forming words correctly, such as reversing sounds in words or confusing words that sound alike Problems remembering or naming letters, numbers and colors Difficulty learning nursery rhymes or playing rhyming games School age Once your child is in school, dyslexia symptoms may become more apparent, including: Reading well below the expected level for age Problems processing and understanding what is heard Difficulty finding the right word or forming answers to questions Problems remembering the sequence of things Difficulty seeing (and occasionally hearing) similarities and differences in letters and words Inability to sound out the pronunciation of an unfamiliar word Difficulty spelling Spending an unusually long time completing tasks that involve reading or writing Avoiding activities that involve reading Teens and adults Dyslexia signs in teens and adults are a lot like those in children.

Dwarfism,"Symptoms — other than short stature — vary greatly across the range of dwarfism conditions. Disproportionate dwarfism Most people with dwarfism have conditions that cause short stature with body parts that aren't the same size as one another. Usually, this means that a person has an average-sized trunk and very short limbs. But some people may have a very short trunk and short limbs. Those limbs are larger than the rest of the body. In these people, the head is large compared with the body. Almost all people with disproportionate dwarfism have average intelligence. Rare exceptions are usually due to a secondary factor, such as excess fluid around the brain. This also is known as hydrocephalus. The most common cause of dwarfism is a condition called achondroplasia, which causes disproportionately short stature. This condition usually results in: An average-sized trunk. Short arms and legs, with particularly short upper arms and upper legs. Short fingers, often with a wide separation between the middle and ring fingers. Limited mobility at the elbows. A large head in relation to the rest of the body, with a prominent forehead and a flattened bridge of the nose. Bowed legs that get worse. Swayed lower back that gets worse. An adult height of 4 feet, 1 inch (125 cm) for women and 4 feet 4 inches (132 cm) for men. Another cause of disproportionate dwarfism is a rare condition called spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita (SEDC). Signs may include: A very short trunk. A short neck. Shortened arms and legs. Average-sized hands and feet. A broad, rounded chest. Slightly flattened cheekbones. An opening in the roof of the mouth, also called a cleft palate. Changes in hip structure that result in thighbones turning inward. A foot that's twisted or out of shape. Neck bones that are not stable. Hunching curvature of the upper spine that gets worse over time. Swayed lower back that gets worse over time. Vision and hearing problems. Arthritis and problems moving joints. Adult height ranging from 3 feet (91 cm) to just over 4 feet (122 cm). Proportionate dwarfism Proportionate dwarfism results from medical conditions present at birth or that occur in early childhood that limit overall growth and development. The head, trunk and limbs are all small, but they're small to the same degree. Because these conditions affect overall growth, poor development of one or more body systems is possible. Growth hormone deficiency is a fairly common cause of proportionate dwarfism. It occurs when the pituitary gland doesn't make enough growth hormone. This hormone is needed for typical childhood growth. Signs include: Height below the third percentile on standard pediatric growth charts. Growth rate slower than expected for age. Delayed or no sexual development during the teen years. When to see a doctor Symptoms of disproportionate dwarfism often are present at birth or in early infancy. Proportionate dwarfism may not be seen at first. See your child's healthcare professional if you are worried about your child's growth or overall development.

Dural arteriovenous fistulas,"Some people with dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVFs) may not have symptoms. When symptoms occur, they may be characterized as benign or aggressive. An aggressive dAVF has more-serious symptoms. Aggressive dAVF symptoms can result from bleeding in the brain, known as intracerebral hemorrhage. Bleeding in the brain often causes a sudden headache. It also may cause other symptoms based on the location and size of the hemorrhage. Aggressive symptoms also may result from nonhemorrhagic neurological deficits (NHNDs), which can include seizures or changes in mental abilities. These symptoms usually develop more gradually, over days to weeks. Symptoms are typically related to the area of the brain affected. Aggressive symptoms can include: Sudden headache. Trouble walking and falls. Seizures. Speech or language issues. Facial pain. Dementia. Slowed movement, stiffness and tremor, known as parkinsonism. Trouble with coordination. Burning or prickling sensations. Weakness. Lack of interest, known as apathy. Failure to thrive. Symptoms related to increased pressure, such as headaches, nausea and vomiting.

Symptoms also may include trouble with vision, such as: Vision changes. Eye bulge. Swelling in the eye lining. Paralysis of a muscle in or around the eye. Rarely, dementia may occur due to increased pressure in the blood vessels in the brain.

Dissociative disorders,"Symptoms depend on the type of dissociative disorder, but may include:  A sense of being separated from yourself and your emotions. Thinking that people and things around you are distorted and not real. A blurred sense of your own identity. Severe stress or problems in relationships, work or other important areas of life. Not being able to cope well with emotional or work-related stress. Memory loss, also called amnesia, of certain time periods, events, people and personal information. Mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. The American Psychiatric Association defines three major dissociative disorders: Depersonalization/derealization disorder, dissociative amnesia, and dissociative identity disorder. Depersonalization/derealization disorder Depersonalization involves a sense of separation from yourself or feeling like you're outside of yourself. You may feel as if you're seeing your actions, feelings, thoughts and self from a distance, like you're watching a movie. Derealization involves feeling that other people and things are separate from you and seem foggy or dreamlike. Time may seem to slow down or speed up. The world may seem unreal. You may go through depersonalization, derealization or both. Symptoms, which can be very distressing, may last hours, days, weeks or months. They may come and go over many years. Or they may become ongoing. Dissociative amnesia The main symptom of dissociative amnesia is memory loss that's more severe than usual forgetfulness. The memory loss can't be explained by a medical condition. You can't recall information about yourself or events and people in your life, especially from a time when you felt shock, distress or pain. A bout of dissociative amnesia usually occurs suddenly. It may last minutes, hours, or rarely, months or years. Dissociative amnesia can be specific to events in a certain time, such as intense combat. More rarely, it can involve complete loss of memory about yourself. It sometimes may involve travel or confused wandering away from your life. This confused wandering is called dissociative fugue. Dissociative identity disorder Formerly known as multiple personality disorder, this disorder involves ""switching"" to other identities. You may feel as if you have two or more people talking or living inside your head. You may feel like you're possessed by other identities. Each identity may have a unique name, personal history and features. These identities sometimes include differences in voice, gender, mannerisms and even such physical qualities as the need for eyeglasses. There also are differences in how familiar each identity is with the others. Dissociative identity disorder usually also includes bouts of amnesia and often includes times of confused wandering. When to see a doctor Sometimes dissociative disorder symptoms occur in a crisis with severe or impulsive behavior. People with these symptoms need care more urgently and in an emergency department at a hospital when safety becomes a concern. If you or a loved one has less urgent symptoms that may be a dissociative disorder, contact your doctor or other health care professional for help. Suicidal thoughts or behavior If you have thoughts of hurting yourself or someone else, call 911 or your local emergency number right away or go to an emergency department. Share your concerns with a trusted relative or friend. Or contact a suicide hotline: In the U.S., call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline , available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Or use the Lifeline Chat at 988lifeline.org/chat/ .

Deviated septum,
Neuromyelitis optica,"Symptoms of neuromyelitis optica are related to the inflammation that occurs in the nerves of the eye and spinal cord. Vision changes caused by NMO are called optic neuritis. These may include: Blurred vision or loss of vision in one or both eyes. Not being able to see color. Eye pain. Symptoms related to the spinal cord are called transverse myelitis. These may include: Stiffness, weakness or numbness in the legs and sometimes in the arms. Loss of feeling in the arms or legs. Not being able to empty the bladder or trouble managing bowel or bladder function. A tingling feeling or shooting pain in the neck, back or stomach. Other symptoms of NMO may include: Hiccups. Nausea and vomiting. Children can have confusion, seizures or coma. However, these symptoms in children are more common in a related condition known as myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD). Symptoms may get better and then worse again. When they get worse, it's known as a relapse. Relapses can happen after weeks, months or years. Over time, relapses can lead to total blindness or loss of feeling, known as paralysis."
Retinal detachment,"Retinal detachment is painless. Often, symptoms are present before a retinal detachment happens or before it has gotten worse. You may notice symptoms such as: The sudden appearance of tiny specks or squiggly lines that seem to drift through your field of vision. These are called floaters. Flashes of light in one or both eyes. These are called photopsias. Blurred vision. Side vision, also called peripheral vision, that becomes worse. A curtainlike shadow over your field of vision. When to see a doctor See a healthcare professional right away if you have any symptoms of retinal detachment. This condition is an emergency that can cause lasting vision loss. Mayo Clinic Minute: What are eye floaters? Show transcript for video Mayo Clinic Minute: What are eye floaters? Jason Howland: Having vision problems? Do you see black or gray specks, strings or cobwebs that drift about when you move your eyes? It could be eye floaters. Amir Khan, M.D., Consultant, Ophthalmology, Mayo Clinic: In the back of our eyes, we have a substance called ""the vitreous."" When we're young, it's a firm clump of jelly. As we age, this firm clump of jelly can liquefy and break up into smaller pieces. Those smaller pieces are what you may notice as floater. Mr. Howland: Eye floaters are more common as you get older and if you're nearsighted. The biggest concern – they can cause retinal tears. Dr. Khan: If a tear develops in the retina, fluid can get in underneath that tear and just lift the retina off like wallpaper off a wall and that's a retinal detachment. Mr. Howland: And that can cause blindness, which is why it's especially important to have a dilated eye exam within days of noticing new floaters or changes in vision. Most eye floaters don't require treatment, but your eye doctor likely will recommend regular eye exams to ensure the condition doesn't worsen. For the Mayo Clinic Newsnetwork, I'm Jason Howland.

Teen depression,"Teen depression signs and symptoms include a change from the teenager's previous attitude and behavior that can cause significant distress and problems at school or home, in social activities, or in other areas of life. Depression symptoms can vary in severity, but changes in your teen's emotions and behavior may include the examples below. Emotional changes Be alert for emotional changes, such as: Feelings of sadness, which can include crying spells for no apparent reason Frustration or feelings of anger, even over small matters Feeling hopeless or empty Irritable or annoyed mood Loss of interest or pleasure in usual activities Loss of interest in, or conflict with, family and friends Low self-esteem Feelings of worthlessness or guilt Fixation on past failures or exaggerated self-blame or self-criticism Extreme sensitivity to rejection or failure, and the need for excessive reassurance Trouble thinking, concentrating, making decisions and remembering things Ongoing sense that life and the future are grim and bleak Frequent thoughts of death, dying or suicide Behavioral changes Watch for changes in behavior, such as: Tiredness and loss of energy Insomnia or sleeping too much Changes in appetite — decreased appetite and weight loss, or increased cravings for food and weight gain Use of alcohol or drugs Agitation or restlessness — for example, pacing, hand-wringing or an inability to sit still Slowed thinking, speaking or body movements Frequent complaints of unexplained body aches and headaches, which may include frequent visits to the school nurse Social isolation Poor school performance or frequent absences from school Less attention to personal hygiene or appearance Angry outbursts, disruptive or risky behavior, or other acting-out behaviors Self-harm — for example, cutting or burning Making a suicide plan or a suicide attempt What's normal and what's not It can be difficult to tell the difference between ups and downs that are just part of being a teenager and teen depression. Talk with your teen. Try to determine whether he or she seems capable of managing challenging feelings, or if life seems overwhelming. When to see a doctor If depression signs and symptoms continue, begin to interfere in your teen's life, or cause you to have concerns about suicide or your teen's safety, talk to a doctor or a mental health professional trained to work with adolescents. Your teen's family doctor or pediatrician is a good place to start. Or your teen's school may recommend someone. Depression symptoms likely won't get better on their own — and they may get worse or lead to other problems if untreated. Depressed teenagers may be at risk of suicide, even if signs and symptoms don't appear to be severe. If you're a teen and you think you may be depressed — or you have a friend who may be depressed — don't wait to get help. Talk to a health care provider such as your doctor or school nurse. Share your concerns with a parent, a close friend, a spiritual leader, a teacher or someone else you trust. Symptoms Suicide is often associated with depression. If you think you may hurt yourself or attempt suicide, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Also consider these options if you're having suicidal thoughts: Call your mental health professional. Contact a suicide hotline. In the U.S., call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline , available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Or use the Lifeline Chat . The Spanish language phone line is 1-888-628-9454 (toll-free). Services are free and confidential. Or contact a crisis service for teenagers in the U.S. called TXT 4 HELP : Text the word ""safe"" and your current location to 4HELP (44357) for immediate help, with the option for interactive texting. Seek help from your primary care doctor or other health care provider. Reach out to a close friend or loved one. Contact a minister, spiritual leader or someone else in your faith community. If a loved one or friend is in danger of attempting suicide or has made an attempt: Make sure someone stays with that person. Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Or, if you can do so safely, take the person to the nearest hospital emergency room. Never ignore comments or concerns about suicide. Always take action to get help.

Postpartum depression,"Symptoms of depression after childbirth vary, and they can range from mild to severe. Baby blues symptoms Symptoms of baby blues — which last only a few days to a week or two after your baby is born — may include: Mood swings Anxiety Sadness Irritability Feeling overwhelmed Crying Reduced concentration Appetite problems Trouble sleeping Postpartum depression symptoms Postpartum depression may be mistaken for baby blues at first — but the symptoms are more intense and last longer. These may eventually interfere with your ability to care for your baby and handle other daily tasks. Symptoms usually develop within the first few weeks after giving birth. But they may begin earlier — during pregnancy — or later — up to a year after birth. Postpartum depression symptoms may include: Depressed mood or severe mood swings Crying too much Difficulty bonding with your baby Withdrawing from family and friends Loss of appetite or eating much more than usual Inability to sleep, called insomnia, or sleeping too much Overwhelming tiredness or loss of energy Less interest and pleasure in activities you used to enjoy Intense irritability and anger Fear that you're not a good mother Hopelessness Feelings of worthlessness, shame, guilt or inadequacy Reduced ability to think clearly, concentrate or make decisions Restlessness Severe anxiety and panic attacks Thoughts of harming yourself or your baby Recurring thoughts of death or suicide Untreated, postpartum depression may last for many months or longer. Postpartum psychosis With postpartum psychosis — a rare condition that usually develops within the first week after delivery — the symptoms are severe. Symptoms may include: Feeling confused and lost Having obsessive thoughts about your baby Hallucinating and having delusions Having sleep problems Having too much energy and feeling upset Feeling paranoid Making attempts to harm yourself or your baby Postpartum psychosis may lead to life-threatening thoughts or behaviors and requires immediate treatment. Postpartum depression in the other parent Studies show that new fathers can experience postpartum depression, too. They may feel sad, tired, overwhelmed, anxious, or have changes in their usual eating and sleeping patterns. These are the same symptoms that mothers with postpartum depression experience. Fathers who are young, have a history of depression, experience relationship problems or are struggling financially are most at risk of postpartum depression. Postpartum depression in fathers — sometimes called paternal postpartum depression — can have the same negative effect on partner relationships and child development as postpartum depression in mothers can. If you're a partner of a new mother and are having symptoms of depression or anxiety during your partner's pregnancy or after your child's birth, talk to your health care provider. Similar treatments and supports provided to mothers with postpartum depression can help treat postpartum depression in the other parent. When to see a doctor If you're feeling depressed after your baby's birth, you may be reluctant or embarrassed to admit it. But if you experience any symptoms of postpartum baby blues or postpartum depression, call your primary health care provider or your obstetrician or gynecologist and schedule an appointment. If you have symptoms that suggest you may have postpartum psychosis, get help immediately. It's important to call your provider as soon as possible if the symptoms of depression have any of these features: Don't fade after two weeks. Are getting worse. Make it hard for you to care for your baby. Make it hard to complete everyday tasks. Include thoughts of harming yourself or your baby. If you have suicidal thoughts If at any point you have thoughts of harming yourself or your baby, immediately seek help from your partner or loved ones in taking care of your baby. Call 911 or your local emergency assistance number to get help. Also consider these options if you're having suicidal thoughts: Seek help from a health care provider. Call a mental health provider. Contact a suicide hotline. In the U.S., call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline , available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Or use the Lifeline Chat . Services are free and confidential. The Suicide & Crisis Lifeline in the U.S. has a Spanish language phone line at 1-888-628-9454 (toll-free). Reach out to a close friend or loved one. Contact a minister, spiritual leader or someone else in your faith community. Helping a friend or loved one People with depression may not recognize or admit that they're depressed. They may not be aware of signs and symptoms of depression. If you suspect that a friend or loved one has postpartum depression or is developing postpartum psychosis, help them seek medical attention immediately. Don't wait and hope for improvement.

Depersonalization-derealization disorder,"Short experiences of depersonalization or derealization are fairly common. But lasting and returning bouts of these symptoms can cause problems at work or school, or in other important areas of your life. During these bouts, you know that your sense of not being connected to your body or your surroundings are only feelings and not reality. The experience and feelings of the condition can be hard to describe. Worrying about ""going crazy"" can cause you to become focused on checking that you exist and finding out what's real. Symptoms usually begin in the middle or late teenage years, or in early adulthood. Depersonalization-derealization disorder is rare in children and older adults. Depersonalization symptoms Symptoms of depersonalization include: Feelings that you're seeing your thoughts, feelings, or body or parts of your body from the outside. For example, you may feel like you're floating in the air above yourself. Feeling like a robot or that you're not in control of what you say or how you move. The sense that your body, legs or arms appear twisted or like they're not the right shape. Or they may seem larger or smaller than usual. You also could feel that your head is wrapped in cotton. Emotional or physical numbness of your senses or responses to the world around you. A sense that your memories lack emotion, and they may or may not be your own memories. Derealization symptoms Symptoms of derealization include: Feeling that people and your surroundings are not real, like you're living in a movie or a dream. Feeling emotionally disconnected from people you care about, as if you were separated by a glass wall. Surroundings that appear out of their usual shape, or are blurry or colorless. Or they may seem like they only have two dimensions, so they're flat with no depth. Or you could be more aware of your surroundings, and they may appear clearer than usual. Thoughts about time that are not real, such as recent events feeling like the distant past. Unrealistic thoughts about distance and the size and shape of objects. Bouts of depersonalization-derealization disorder may last hours, days, weeks or months. In some people, these bouts turn into ongoing feelings of depersonalization or derealization that may get better or worse at times. When to see a doctor Passing feelings of depersonalization or derealization are common and are not always a cause for concern. But ongoing or serious feelings of detachment and distortion of your surroundings can be a sign of depersonalization-derealization disorder or another physical or mental health condition. See a doctor if you have feelings of depersonalization or derealization that: Are disturbing you or are disrupting your emotions. Do not go away or keep coming back. Get in the way of work, relationships or daily activities. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Dengue fever,"Many people experience no signs or symptoms of a dengue infection. When symptoms do occur, they may be mistaken for other illnesses — such as the flu — and usually begin four to 10 days after you are bitten by an infected mosquito. Dengue fever causes a high fever — 104 F (40 C) — and any of the following signs and symptoms: Headache Muscle, bone or joint pain Nausea Vomiting Pain behind the eyes Swollen glands Rash Most people recover within a week or so. In some cases, symptoms worsen and can become life-threatening. This is called severe dengue, dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome. Severe dengue happens when your blood vessels become damaged and leaky. And the number of clot-forming cells (platelets) in your bloodstream drops. This can lead to shock, internal bleeding, organ failure and even death. Warning signs of severe dengue fever — which is a life-threatening emergency — can develop quickly. The warning signs usually begin the first day or two after your fever goes away, and may include: Severe stomach pain Persistent vomiting Bleeding from your gums or nose Blood in your urine, stools or vomit Bleeding under the skin, which might look like bruising Difficult or rapid breathing Fatigue Irritability or restlessness When to see a doctor Severe dengue fever is a life-threatening medical emergency. Seek immediate medical attention if you've recently visited an area in which dengue fever is known to occur, you have had a fever and you develop any of the warning signs. Warning signs include severe stomach pain, vomiting, difficulty breathing, or blood in your nose, gums, vomit or stools. If you've been traveling recently and develop a fever and mild symptoms of dengue fever, call your doctor. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Delirium,"Symptoms of delirium usually begin over a few hours or a few days. They typically occur with a medical problem. Symptoms often come and go during the day. There may be periods of no symptoms. Symptoms tend to be worse at night when it's dark and things look less familiar. They also tend to be worse in settings that aren't familiar, such as in a hospital. Primary symptoms include the following. Reduced awareness of surroundings This may result in: Trouble focusing on a topic or changing topics Getting stuck on an idea rather than responding to questions Being easily distracted Being withdrawn, with little or no activity or little response to surroundings Poor thinking skills This may appear as: Poor memory, such as forgetting recent events Not knowing where they are or who they are Trouble with speech or recalling words Rambling or nonsense speech Trouble understanding speech Trouble reading or writing Behavior and emotional changes These may include: Anxiety, fear or distrust of others Depression A short temper or anger A sense of feeling elated Lack of interest and emotion Quick changes in mood Personality changes Seeing things that others don't see Being restless, anxious or combative Calling out, moaning or making other sounds Being quiet and withdrawn — especially in older adults Slowed movement or being sluggish Changes in sleep habits A switched night-day sleep-wake cycle Types of delirium Experts have identified three types: Hyperactive delirium. This may be the easiest type to recognize. People with this type may be restless and pace the room. They also may be anxious, have rapid mood swings or see things that aren't there. People with this type often resist care. Hypoactive delirium. People with this type may be inactive or have reduced activity. They tend to be sluggish or drowsy. They might seem to be in a daze. They don't interact with family or others. Mixed delirium. Symptoms involve both types of delirium. The person may quickly switch back and forth from being restless and sluggish. Delirium and dementia Delirium and dementia may be hard to tell apart, and a person may have both. Someone with dementia has a gradual decline of memory and other thinking skills due to damage or loss of brain cells. The most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer's disease, which comes on slowly over months or years. Delirium often occurs in people with dementia. However, episodes of delirium don't always mean a person has dementia. Tests for dementia shouldn't be done during a delirium episode because the results could be misleading. Some differences between the symptoms of delirium and dementia include: Onset. The onset of delirium occurs within a short time — within a day or two. Dementia usually begins with minor symptoms that get worse over time. Attention. The ability to stay focused or maintain focus is impaired with delirium. A person in the early stages of dementia remains generally alert. Someone with dementia often isn't sluggish or agitated. Rapid changes in symptoms. Delirium symptoms can come and go several times during the day. While people with dementia have better and worse times of day, their memory and thinking skills typically stay at a constant level. When to see a doctor If a relative, friend or someone in your care shows symptoms of delirium, talk to the person's health care provider. Your input about symptoms, typical thinking and usual abilities will be important for a diagnosis. It also can help the provider find the cause of the disorder. If you notice symptoms in someone in the hospital or nursing home, report your concerns to the nursing staff or health care provider. The symptoms may not have been observed. Older people who are in the hospital or are living in a long-term care center are at risk of delirium. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Delayed ejaculation,"There's no set time that means a diagnosis of delayed ejaculation. Some people with delayed ejaculation need many minutes of sexual stimulation to have an orgasm and ejaculate. Others might not be able to ejaculate at all, called anejaculation. In delayed ejaculation, the delay causes upset. Also delayed ejaculation might mean stopping sex due to tiredness, physical irritation, loss of erection or because the partner wants to stop. Often, there's trouble reaching orgasm during sexual intercourse or other sexual activities with a partner. Some people can ejaculate only when masturbating. But others may not be able to ejaculate by masturbating. Delayed ejaculation is divided into the following types based on symptoms: Lifelong versus acquired. With lifelong delayed ejaculation, the problem is present from the time of sexual maturity. Acquired delayed ejaculation happens after a period of typical sexual functioning. Generalized versus situational. Generalized delayed ejaculation isn't limited to certain sex partners or certain kinds of arousal. Situational delayed ejaculation happens only under certain conditions. When to see a doctor Your main healthcare professional is a good place to start when you have delayed ejaculation. See your healthcare professional if: Delayed ejaculation is an issue for you or your partner. You have another health problem that might be linked to delayed ejaculation. Or you take medicines that could cause delayed ejaculation. You have other symptoms along with delayed ejaculation that might or might not seem linked. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS),"Ductal carcinoma in situ doesn't typically cause symptoms. This early form of breast cancer also is called DCIS. DCIS can sometimes cause symptoms such as: A breast lump. Bloody nipple discharge. DCIS is usually found on a mammogram. It appears as tiny flecks of calcium in the breast tissue. These are calcium deposits, often referred to as calcifications. When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor or other healthcare professional if you notice a change in your breasts. Changes to look for may include a lump, an area of puckered or otherwise unusual skin, a thickened region under the skin, and nipple discharge.

Sorry something went wrong with your subscription Please, try again in a couple of minutes Retry Causes It's not clear what causes ductal carcinoma in situ, also called DCIS. This early form of breast cancer happens when cells inside a breast duct develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. In cancer cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. The changes tell the cancer cells to make many more cells quickly. Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells. In DCIS, the cancer cells don't yet have the ability to break out of the breast duct and spread into the breast tissue. Healthcare professionals don't know exactly what causes the changes in the cells that leads to DCIS. Factors that may play a part include lifestyle, environment and DNA changes that run in families. Risk factors Several factors may increase the risk of ductal carcinoma in situ, also called DCIS. DCIS is an early form of breast cancer. Risk factors for breast cancer may include: A family history of breast cancer. If a parent, sibling or child had breast cancer, your risk of breast cancer is increased. The risk is higher if your family has a history of getting breast cancer at a young age. The risk also is higher if you have multiple family members with breast cancer. Still, most people diagnosed with breast cancer don't have a family history of the disease. A personal history of breast cancer. If you've had cancer in one breast, you have an increased risk of getting cancer in the other breast. A personal history of breast conditions. Certain breast conditions are a sign of a higher risk of breast cancer. These conditions include lobular carcinoma in situ, also called LCIS, and atypical hyperplasia of the breast. If you've had a breast biopsy that found one of these conditions, you have an increased risk of breast cancer. Beginning your period at a younger age. Beginning your period before age 12 increases the risk of breast cancer. Beginning menopause at an older age. Beginning menopause after age 55 increases the risk of breast cancer. Being female. Women are much more likely than men are to get breast cancer. Everyone is born with some breast tissue, so anyone can get breast cancer. Dense breast tissue. Breast tissue is made up of fatty tissue and dense tissue. Dense tissue is made of milk glands, milk ducts and fibrous tissue. If you have dense breasts, you have more dense tissue than fatty tissue in your breasts. Having dense breasts can make it harder to detect breast cancer on a mammogram. If a mammogram showed that you have dense breasts, your risk of breast cancer is increased. Talk with your healthcare team about other tests you might have in addition to mammograms to look for breast cancer. Drinking alcohol. Drinking alcohol increases the risk of breast cancer. Having your first child at an older age. Giving birth to your first child after age 30 may increase the risk of breast cancer. Having never been pregnant. Having been pregnant one or more times lowers the risk of breast cancer. Never having been pregnant increases the risk. Increasing age. The risk of breast cancer goes up as you get older. Inherited DNA changes that increase cancer risk. Certain DNA changes that increase the risk of breast cancer can be passed from parents to children. The most well-known changes are called BRCA1 and BRCA2. These changes can greatly increase your risk of breast cancer and other cancers, but not everyone with these DNA changes gets cancer. Menopausal hormone therapy. Taking certain hormone therapy medicines to control the symptoms of menopause may increase the risk of breast cancer. The risk is linked to hormone therapy medicines that combine estrogen and progesterone. The risk goes down when you stop taking these medicines. Obesity. People with obesity have an increased risk of breast cancer. Radiation exposure. If you received radiation treatments to your chest as a child or young adult, your risk of breast cancer is higher. Prevention Making changes in your daily life may help lower your risk of ductal carcinoma in situ. This early form of breast cancer also is called DCIS. To lower your risk of breast cancer, try to: Ask about breast cancer screening Talk with your doctor or other healthcare professional about when to begin breast cancer screening. Ask about the benefits and risks of screening. Together, you can decide what breast cancer screening tests are right for you. Become familiar with your breasts through breast self-exam for breast awareness You may choose to become familiar with your breasts by occasionally inspecting them during a breast self-exam for breast awareness. If you find a new change, lumps or other unusual signs in your breasts, tell a healthcare professional right away. Breast awareness can't prevent breast cancer. But it may help you to better understand the look and feel of your breasts. This might make it more likely that you'll notice if something changes. Drink alcohol in moderation, if at all If you choose to drink alcohol, limit the amount you drink to no more than one drink a day. For breast cancer prevention, there is no safe amount of alcohol. So if you're very concerned about your breast cancer risk, you may choose to not drink alcohol. Exercise most days of the week Aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise on most days of the week. If you haven't been active lately, ask your healthcare professional whether exercising is OK and start slowly. Limit hormone therapy during menopause Combination hormone therapy may increase the risk of breast cancer. Talk with a healthcare professional about the benefits and risks of hormone therapy. Some people have symptoms during menopause that cause discomfort. These people may decide that the risks of hormone therapy are acceptable to get relief. To reduce the risk of breast cancer, use the lowest dose of hormone therapy possible for the shortest amount of time. Maintain a healthy weight If your weight is healthy, work to maintain that weight. If you need to lose weight, ask a healthcare professional about healthy ways to lower your weight. Eat fewer calories and slowly increase the amount you exercise. By Mayo Clinic Staff Request an appointment Diagnosis & treatment July 19, 2024 Print Living with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)?

Narcolepsy,"The symptoms of narcolepsy may get worse during the first few years. Then they continue for life. Symptoms include: Extreme daytime sleepiness. Daytime sleepiness is the first symptom to appear, and the sleepiness makes it hard to focus and function. People with narcolepsy feel less alert and focused during the day. They also fall asleep without warning. Sleep can happen anywhere and at any time. It may happen when they are bored or while doing a task. For example, people with narcolepsy can suddenly fall asleep while working or talking with friends. It can be especially dangerous to fall asleep while driving. Sleep may last only a few minutes or up to a half-hour. After waking, people with narcolepsy feel refreshed but get sleepy again. Automatic behaviors. Some people with narcolepsy continue doing a task when they fall asleep briefly. For example, they may fall asleep while writing, typing or driving. They might continue to perform that task while asleep. After waking, they can't remember what they did, and they probably didn't do it well. Sudden loss of muscle tone. This condition is called cataplexy. It can cause slurred speech or complete weakness of most muscles for up to a few minutes. It's triggered by intense emotions — often positive emotions. Laughter or excitement may cause sudden muscle weakness. But sometimes fear, surprise or anger can cause the loss of muscle tone. For example, when you laugh, your head may drop without your control. Or your knees may suddenly lose strength, causing you to fall. Some people with narcolepsy experience only one or two episodes of cataplexy a year. Others have several episodes a day. Not everyone with narcolepsy has these symptoms. Sleep paralysis. People with narcolepsy may experience sleep paralysis. During sleep paralysis, the person can't move or speak while falling asleep or upon waking. The paralysis is usually brief — lasting a few seconds or minutes. But it can be scary. You may be aware of it happening and can recall it afterward. Not everyone with sleep paralysis has narcolepsy. Hallucinations. Sometimes people see things that aren't there during sleep paralysis. Hallucinations also may happen in bed without sleep paralysis. These are called hypnagogic hallucinations if they happen as you fall asleep. They're called hypnopompic hallucinations if they happen upon waking. For example, the person might think they see a stranger in the bedroom who isn't there. These hallucinations may be vivid and frightening because you may not be fully asleep when you begin dreaming. Changes in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. REM sleep is when most dreaming happens. Typically, people enter REM sleep 60 to 90 minutes after falling asleep. But people with narcolepsy often move more quickly to REM sleep. They tend to enter REM sleep within 15 minutes of falling asleep. REM sleep also can happen at any time of the day. Other sleep symptoms People with narcolepsy may have other sleep conditions. They might have obstructive sleep apnea, in which breathing starts and stops during the night. Or they may act out their dreams, known as REM sleep behavior disorder. Or they may have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, called insomnia. When to see a doctor See your healthcare professional if you experience daytime sleepiness that affects your personal or professional life. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Cyclic vomiting syndrome,
Cyclothymia (cyclothymic disorder),"Cyclothymia symptoms alternate between emotional highs and lows. The highs of cyclothymia include symptoms of an elevated mood (hypomanic symptoms). The lows consist of mild or moderate depressive symptoms. Cyclothymia symptoms are similar to those of bipolar I or II disorder, but they're less severe. When you have cyclothymia, you can typically function in your daily life, though not always well. The unpredictable nature of your mood shifts may significantly disrupt your life because you never know how you're going to feel. Hypomanic symptoms Signs and symptoms of the highs of cyclothymia may include: An exaggerated feeling of happiness or well-being (euphoria) Extreme optimism Inflated self-esteem Talking more than usual Poor judgment that can result in risky behavior or unwise choices Racing thoughts Irritable or agitated behavior Excessive physical activity Increased drive to perform or achieve goals (sexual, work related or social) Decreased need for sleep Tendency to be easily distracted Inability to concentrate Depressive symptoms Signs and symptoms of the lows of cyclothymia may include: Feeling sad, hopeless or empty Tearfulness Irritability, especially in children and teenagers Loss of interest in activities once considered enjoyable Changes in weight Feelings of worthlessness or guilt Sleep problems Restlessness Fatigue or feeling slowed down Problems concentrating Thinking of death or suicide When to see a doctor If you have any symptoms of cyclothymia, seek medical help as soon as possible. Cyclothymia generally doesn't get better on its own. If you're reluctant to seek treatment, work up the courage to confide in someone who can help you take that first step. If a loved one has symptoms of cyclothymia, talk openly and honestly with that person about your concerns. You can't force someone to seek professional help, but you can offer support and help find a qualified doctor or mental health provider. Suicidal thoughts Although suicidal thoughts might occur with cyclothymia, they're more likely to occur if you have bipolar I or II disorder. If you're considering suicide right now: Call 911 or your local emergency services number, or go to a hospital emergency department. Contact a suicide hotline. In the U.S., call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline , available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Or use the Lifeline Chat . Services are free and confidential. If you just can't make that call, reach out to someone else — immediately — such as your doctor, mental health provider, family member, friend or someone in your faith community.

Self-injury/cutting,"Symptoms of self-injury may include: Scars, often in patterns. Fresh cuts, scratches, bruises, bite marks or other wounds. Excessive rubbing of an area to create a burn. Keeping sharp objects or other items used for self-injury on hand. Wearing long sleeves or long pants to hide self-injury, even in hot weather. Frequent reports of accidental injury. Difficulties in relationships with others. Behaviors and emotions that change quickly and are impulsive, intense and unexpected. Talk of helplessness, hopelessness or worthlessness. Forms of self-injury Self-injury mostly happens in private. Usually, it's done in a controlled manner or the same way each time, which often leaves a pattern on the skin. Examples of self-harm include: Cutting, scratching or stabbing with a sharp object, one of the most common methods. Burning with lit matches, cigarettes or heated, sharp objects such as knives. Carving words or symbols on the skin. Self-hitting, punching, biting or head banging. Piercing the skin with sharp objects. Inserting objects under the skin. Most frequently, the arms, legs, chest and belly are the targets of self-injury. But any area of the body may be a target, sometimes using more than one method. Becoming upset can trigger urges to self-injure. Many people self-injure only a few times and then stop. But for others, self-injury can become a longer term, repeated behavior. When to see a doctor If you're injuring yourself, even in a minor way, or if you have thoughts of harming yourself, reach out for help. Any form of self-injury is a sign of bigger stressors that need attention. Talk to someone you trust — such as a friend, family member, health care provider, spiritual leader, or a school counselor, nurse or teacher. They can help you take the first steps to successful treatment. While you may feel ashamed and embarrassed about your behavior, you can find supportive, caring help from people who aren't going to judge you. When a friend or family member self-injures If you have a friend or family member who is self-injuring, you may be shocked and scared. Take all talk of self-injury seriously. Although you might feel that you'd be betraying a confidence, self-injury is too big a problem to ignore or to deal with alone. Here are some ways to help. Your child. You can start by talking with your pediatrician or other health care provider who can do an initial evaluation or make a referral to a mental health professional. Express your concern, but don't yell at your child or make threats or accusations. Preteen or teenage friend. Suggest that your friend talk to parents, a teacher, a school counselor or another trusted adult. Adult. Gently express your concern and encourage the person to seek medical and mental health treatment When to get emergency help If you've injured yourself severely or believe your injury may be life-threatening, or if you think you may hurt yourself or attempt suicide, call 911 or your local emergency number right away. Also consider these options if you're having suicidal thoughts: Call your mental health provider if you're seeing one. Contact a suicide hotline. In the U.S., call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline , available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Or use the Lifeline Chat . Services are free and confidential. The Suicide & Crisis Lifeline in the U.S. has a Spanish language phone line at 1-888-628-9454 (toll-free). Seek help from your school nurse or counselor, teacher, or health care provider.

Peyronie disease,"Peyronie disease symptoms might start suddenly or appear over time. The most common symptoms include: Scar tissue. The scar tissue linked with Peyronie disease also is called plaque. It's different from plaque that can build up in blood vessels or on your teeth. It can be felt under the skin of the penis as flat lumps or a band of hard tissue. The area over the scar tissue may feel tender. A bend to the penis. The penis might curve upward or downward or bend to one side. Erection problems. Peyronie disease might cause problems getting or keeping an erection. This also is called erectile dysfunction. Often though, people with Peyronie disease say they notice erectile dysfunction before the start of their other penile symptoms. Shortening of the penis. The penis might become shorter during erections due to Peyronie disease. Pain in the penis. This symptom might happen with or without an erection. Other changes in how the penis looks. In some people with Peyronie disease, the erect penis might look narrow or indented. It might even take on an hourglass-like shape, with a tight, narrow band around the shaft. The curving and penile shortening linked with Peyronie disease might become worse over time. Physical changes in the penis often get worse or stay the same during the first year to year and a half. Pain during erections usually gets better within 1 to 2 years. The scar tissue, penile shortening and curving often remain. It's not common, but the curving and pain of Peyronie disease can get better without treatment. When to see a doctor See a health care professional if you notice symptoms of Peyronie disease. Early treatment gives you the best chance to improve the condition or keep it from getting worse. If you've had the condition for some time, get a health care checkup if the pain, curving, length, or other changes bother you or your partner.

Undescended testicle,"Not seeing or feeling a testicle in the scrotum is the main symptom of an undescended testicle. Testicles form in an unborn baby's lower belly. During the last few months of pregnancy, the testicles typically move down from the stomach area. They move through a tubelike passage in the groin, called the inguinal canal, and descend into the scrotum. With an undescended testicle, that process stops or is delayed. When to see a doctor An undescended testicle often is found during an exam done shortly after birth. If your baby has an undescended testicle, ask how often exams will need to be done. If the testicle hasn't moved into the scrotum by 3 to 4 months of age, the condition likely won't correct itself. Treating an undescended testicle when your child is still a baby might lower the risk of health problems later in life. These include cancer of the testicles and not being able to get a partner pregnant, also called infertility. Older boys — from infants to preteens — who have descended testicles at birth might appear to be missing a testicle later. This might be a symptom of: A retractile testicle, which moves back and forth between the scrotum and the groin. The testicle might be easily guided by hand into the scrotum during a physical exam. A retractile testicle is due to a muscle reflex in the scrotum. An ascending testicle, which has returned to the groin. The testicle can't be easily guided by hand into the scrotum. Another name for this is an acquired undescended testicle. Talk to your child's doctor or other member of their care team if you notice any changes in your child's genitals or if you have other concerns. Request an appointment"

Some people also get open leg sores, called ulcers. Joint pain. Symptoms like those of rheumatoid arthritis are common in cryoglobulinemia. Peripheral neuropathy.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),"Typical COVID-19 symptoms often show up 2 to 14 days after contact with the virus. Symptoms can include: Dry cough. Shortness of breath. Loss of taste or smell. Extreme tiredness, called fatigue. Digestive symptoms such as upset stomach, vomiting or loose stools, called diarrhea. Pain, such as headaches and body or muscle aches. Fever or chills. Cold-like symptoms such as congestion, runny nose or sore throat. People may only have a few symptoms or none. People who have no symptoms but test positive for COVID-19 are called asymptomatic. For example, many children who test positive don't have symptoms of COVID-19 illness. People who go on to have symptoms are considered presymptomatic. Both groups can still spread COVID-19 to others. Some people may have symptoms that get worse about 7 to 14 days after symptoms start. Most people with COVID-19 have mild to moderate symptoms. But COVID-19 can cause serious medical complications and lead to death. Older adults or people who already have medical conditions are at greater risk of serious illness. COVID-19 may be a mild, moderate, severe or critical illness. In broad terms, mild COVID-19 doesn't affect the ability of the lungs to get oxygen to the body. In moderate COVID-19 illness, the lungs also work properly but there are signs that the infection is deep in the lungs. Severe COVID-19 means that the lungs don't work correctly, and the person needs oxygen and other medical help in the hospital. Critical COVID-19 illness means the lung and breathing system, called the respiratory system, has failed and there is damage throughout the body. Rarely, people who catch the coronavirus can develop a group of symptoms linked to inflamed organs or tissues. The illness is called multisystem inflammatory syndrome. When children have this illness, it is called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, shortened to MIS -C. In adults, the name is MIS -A. When to see a doctor Contact a healthcare professional if you test positive for COVID-19 . If you have symptoms and need to test for COVID-19 , or you've been exposed to someone with COVID-19 , a healthcare professional can help. People who are at high risk of serious illness may get medicine to block the spread of the COVID-19 virus in the body. Or your healthcare team may plan regular checks to monitor your health. Get emergency help right away for any of these symptoms: Can't catch your breath or have problems breathing. Skin, lips or nail beds that are pale, gray or blue. New confusion. Trouble staying awake or waking up. Chest pain or pressure that is constant. This list doesn't include every emergency symptom.

Small vessel disease,
Coronary artery disease,"Symptoms of coronary artery disease happen when the heart doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood. Coronary artery disease symptoms may include: Chest pain, called angina. You may feel squeezing, pressure, heaviness, tightness or pain in the chest. It may feel like somebody is standing on your chest. The chest pain usually affects the middle or left side of the chest. Activity or strong emotions can trigger angina. There are different types of angina. The type depends on the cause and whether rest or medicine makes symptoms better. In some people, especially women, the pain may be brief or sharp and felt in the neck, arm or back. Shortness of breath. You may feel like you can't catch your breath. Fatigue . If the heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs, you may feel unusually tired. Symptoms of coronary artery disease may not be noticed at first. Sometimes symptoms only happen when the heart is beating hard, such as during exercise. As the coronary arteries continue to narrow, symptoms can get more severe or frequent. A completely blocked coronary artery will cause a heart attack. Common heart attack symptoms include: Chest pain that may feel like pressure, tightness, squeezing or aching. Pain or discomfort that spreads to the shoulder, arm, back, neck, jaw, teeth or sometimes the upper belly. Cold sweats. Fatigue. Heartburn. Nausea. Shortness of breath. Lightheadedness or sudden dizziness. Chest pain is usually the most common symptom of heart attack. But for some people, such as women, the elderly and those with diabetes, symptoms may seem unrelated to a heart attack. For example, they may have nausea or a very brief pain in the neck or back. Some people having a heart attack don't notice symptoms. When to see a doctor If you think you're having a heart attack, immediately call 911 or your local emergency number. If you don't have access to emergency medical services, have someone drive you to the nearest hospital. Drive yourself only as a last option. Smoking or having high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity or a strong family history of heart disease makes you more likely to get coronary artery disease. If you're at high risk of coronary artery disease, talk to your healthcare professional. You may need tests to check for narrowed arteries and coronary artery disease.

Conjoined twins,"There are no specific symptoms that indicate a conjoined twin pregnancy. As with other twin pregnancies, the uterus may grow faster than it does with a single baby. And there may be more tiredness, nausea and vomiting early in the pregnancy. Conjoined twins can be diagnosed early in the pregnancy using an ultrasound. How twins are joined Conjoined twins are usually classified according to where they're joined. The twins sometimes share organs or other parts of their bodies. Each pair of conjoined twins is unique. Conjoined twins may be joined at any of these sites: Chest. Thoracopagus (thor-uh-KOP-uh-gus) twins are joined face to face at the chest. They often have a shared heart and may also share one liver and upper intestine. This is one of the most common sites of conjoined twins. Abdomen. Omphalopagus (om-fuh-LOP-uh-gus) twins are joined near the bellybutton. Many omphalopagus twins share the liver and some part of the upper digestive (gastrointestinal or GI) tract. Some twins share the lower part of the small intestine (ileum) and the longest part of the large intestine (colon). They generally do not share a heart. Base of spine. Pygopagus (pie-GOP-uh-gus) twins are commonly joined back to back at the base of the spine and the buttocks. Some pygopagus twins share the lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract. A few twins share the genital and urinary organs. Length of spine. Rachipagus (ray-KIP-uh-gus), also called rachiopagus (ray-kee-OP-uh-gus), twins are joined back to back along the length of the spine. This type is very rare. Pelvis. Ischiopagus (is-kee-OP-uh-gus) twins are joined at the pelvis, either face to face or end to end. Many ischiopagus twins share the lower GI tract, as well as the liver and genital and urinary tract organs. Each twin may have two legs or, less commonly, the twins share two or three legs. Trunk. Parapagus (pa-RAP-uh-gus) twins are joined side to side at the pelvis and part or all of the belly (abdomen) and chest, but with separate heads. The twins can have two, three or four arms and two or three legs. Head. Craniopagus (kray-nee-OP-uh-gus) twins are joined at the back, top or side of the head, but not the face. Craniopagus twins share a portion of the skull. But their brains are usually separate, though they may share some brain tissue. Head and chest. Cephalopagus (sef-uh-LOP-uh-gus) twins are joined at the head and upper body. The faces are on opposite sides of a single shared head, and they share a brain. These twins rarely survive. In rare cases, twins may be conjoined with one twin smaller and less fully formed than the other (asymmetric conjoined twins). In extremely rare cases, one twin may be found partially developed within the other twin (fetus in fetu). Request an appointment"
Heart failure,"Heart failure Enlarge image Close Heart failure Heart failure Heart failure occurs when the heart muscle doesn't pump blood as well as it should. Blood often backs up and causes fluid to build up in the lungs and in the legs. The fluid buildup can cause shortness of breath and swelling of the legs and feet. Poor blood flow may cause the skin to look blue or gray. Depending on your skin color, these color changes may be harder or easier to see. Some types of heart failure can lead to an enlarged heart. If you have heart failure, your heart can't supply enough blood to meet your body's needs. Symptoms may develop slowly. Sometimes, heart failure symptoms start suddenly. Heart failure symptoms may include: Shortness of breath with activity or when lying down. Fatigue and weakness. Swelling in the legs, ankles and feet. Rapid or irregular heartbeat. Reduced ability to exercise. Wheezing. A cough that doesn't go away or a cough that brings up white or pink mucus with spots of blood. Swelling of the belly area. Very rapid weight gain from fluid buildup. Nausea and lack of appetite. Difficulty concentrating or decreased alertness. Chest pain if heart failure is caused by a heart attack. When to see a doctor See your healthcare professional if you think you might have symptoms of heart failure. Call 911 or emergency medical help if you have any of the following: Chest pain. Fainting or severe weakness. Rapid or irregular heartbeat with shortness of breath, chest pain or fainting. Sudden, severe shortness of breath and coughing up white or pink, foamy mucus. These symptoms may be due to heart failure. But there are many other possible causes. Don't try to diagnose yourself. At the emergency room, healthcare professionals do tests to learn if your symptoms are due to heart failure or something else. Call your healthcare professional right away if you have heart failure and: Your symptoms suddenly get worse. You develop a new symptom. You gain 5 pounds (2.3 kilograms) or more within a few days. Such changes could mean that existing heart failure is getting worse or that treatment isn't working. More Information Heart failure care at Mayo Clinic Cardiac asthma: What causes it?

Craniosynostosis,"The signs of craniosynostosis are usually noticeable at birth, but they become more apparent during the first few months of your baby's life. Signs and severity depend on how many sutures are fused and when in brain development the fusion occurs. Signs and symptoms can include: A misshapen skull, with the shape depending on which of the sutures are affected Development of a raised, hard ridge along affected sutures, with a change in the shape of the head that's not typical Types of craniosynostosis There are several types of craniosynostosis. Most involve the fusion of a single cranial suture. Some complex forms of craniosynostosis involve the fusion of multiple sutures. Multiple suture craniosynostosis is usually linked to genetic syndromes and is called syndromic craniosynostosis. The term given to each type of craniosynostosis depends on what sutures are affected. Types of craniosynostosis include: Sagittal (scaphocephaly). Premature fusion of the sagittal suture that runs from the front to the back at the top of the skull forces the head to grow long and narrow. This head shape is called scaphocephaly. Sagittal craniosynostosis is the most common type of craniosynostosis. Coronal. Premature fusion of one of the coronal sutures (unicoronal) that run from each ear to the top of the skull may cause the forehead to flatten on the affected side and bulge on the unaffected side. It also leads to turning of the nose and a raised eye socket on the affected side. When both coronal sutures fuse prematurely (bicoronal), the head has a short and wide appearance, often with the forehead tilted forward. Metopic. The metopic suture runs from the top of the bridge of the nose up through the midline of the forehead to the anterior fontanel and the sagittal suture. Premature fusion gives the forehead a triangular appearance and widens the back part of the head. This head shape is also called trigonocephaly. Lambdoid. Lambdoid synostosis is a rare type of craniosynostosis that involves the lambdoid suture, which runs along the back of the head. It may cause one side of a baby's head to appear flat, one ear to be higher than the other ear and tilting of the top of the head to one side. Other reasons for a misshapen head A misshapen head doesn't always indicate craniosynostosis. For example, if the back of your baby's head appears flattened, it could be the result of spending too much time lying on one side of the head. This can be treated with regular position changes, or if significant, with helmet therapy (cranial orthosis) to help reshape the head to a more balanced appearance. When to see a doctor Your health care provider will routinely monitor your child's head growth at well-child visits. Talk to your pediatrician if you have concerns about your baby's head growth or shape. Request an appointment"
Congenital myasthenic syndromes,"Congenital myasthenic syndromes are typically identified at birth. But if signs and symptoms are mild, the condition may not be identified until childhood, or rarely, early adulthood. Depending on the type of congenital myasthenic syndrome, the severity of signs and symptoms vary greatly, from minor weakness to the inability to move. Some symptoms can be life-threatening. Common to all congenital myasthenic syndromes is muscle weakness that worsens with physical activity. Any muscles used for movement can be affected, but the most commonly affected muscles are those that control movement of the eyelids and eyes and chewing and swallowing. During infancy and early childhood, progressive loss of essential voluntary muscle activity occurs with muscle use. Impaired muscle weakness can result in: Droopy eyelids and poor eye control, often with double vision. Difficulty chewing and swallowing. Weakness of facial muscles. Weak cry. Slurring or nasal speech. Delayed crawling and walking. Delayed development of wrist, hand and finger skills, such as brushing teeth or combing hair. Trouble supporting the head in an upright position. Problems breathing, such as feeling short of breath and having short pauses in breathing, sometimes worsened by infection, fever or stress. Depending on the type of congenital myasthenic syndrome, other signs and symptoms can include: Skeletal deformities, such as joint, spine or foot deformities. Unusual facial features, such as narrow jaw or wide-set eyes. Hearing loss. Weakness, numbness and pain, usually in hands and feet. Seizures. Kidney problems. Cognitive impairment, rarely. When to see a doctor Talk to your doctor if you observe any signs listed above in your child or if you have concerns about your own signs or symptoms. Request an appointment"
Congenital heart disease in adults,
Hirschsprung's disease,
Congenital heart disease in adults,"Some people born with a heart problem don't notice symptoms until later in life. Symptoms also may return years after a congenital heart defect is treated. Common congenital heart disease symptoms in adults include: Irregular heartbeats, called arrhythmias. Blue or gray skin, lips and fingernails due to low oxygen levels. Depending on the skin color, these changes may be harder or easier to see. Shortness of breath. Feeling tired very quickly with activity. Swelling due to fluid collecting inside body tissues, called edema. When to see a doctor Get emergency medical help if you have unexplained chest pain or shortness of breath. Make an appointment for a health checkup if: You have symptoms of adult congenital heart disease. You received treatment for a congenital heart defect as a child. Request an appointment"
Congenital heart defects in children,"Serious congenital heart defects usually are found soon after birth or during the first few months of life. Symptoms could include: Pale gray or blue lips, tongue, or fingernails. Depending on the skin color, these changes may be harder or easier to see. Rapid breathing. Swelling in the legs, belly or areas around the eyes. Shortness of breath during feedings, leading to poor weight gain. Less-serious congenital heart defects may not be found until later in childhood. Symptoms of congenital heart defects in older children may include: Easily getting short of breath during exercise or activity. Getting tired very easily during exercise or activity. Fainting during exercise or activity. Swelling in the hands, ankles or feet. When to see a doctor Serious congenital heart defects are often diagnosed before or soon after a child is born. If you think that your baby has symptoms of a heart condition, call your child's healthcare professional. Request an appointment"
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia,"Symptoms of CAH vary. The symptoms depend on which gene is affected. They also depend on how greatly the adrenal glands lack one of the enzymes needed to make hormones. With CAH , the hormones that the body needs to work properly are thrown out of balance. That may lead to too little cortisol, too little aldosterone, too many androgens or a mix of these issues. Classic CAH Symptoms of classic CAH can include: Not enough cortisol. With classic CAH , the body doesn't make enough of the hormone cortisol. This can cause problems keeping blood pressure, blood sugar and energy at healthy levels. It also can cause problems during physical stress such as illness. Adrenal crisis. People with classic CAH can be seriously affected by a lack of cortisol, aldosterone or both. This is known as an adrenal crisis. It can be life-threatening. External genitals that don't look typical. In female infants, some parts of the genitals on the outside of the body may look different than usual. For instance, the clitoris may be enlarged and resemble a penis. The labia may be partly closed and look like a scrotum. The tube through which urine leaves the body and the vagina may be one opening instead of two separate openings. The uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries often develop in a typical manner. Male infants with CAH often have genitals that look typical but sometimes are enlarged. Too much androgen. An excess of the male sex hormone androgen can lead to short height and early puberty for children. Pubic hair and other signs of puberty may appear at a very early age. Serious acne also may occur. Extra androgen hormones in females may lead to facial hair, more body hair than usual and a deeper voice. Altered growth. Children may grow fast. And their bones could be more developed than is typical for their age. Final height may be shorter than average. Fertility issues. These can include irregular menstrual periods or not having periods at all. Some women with classic CAH may have trouble becoming pregnant. Fertility issues sometimes can occur in men. Nonclassic CAH Often, there are no symptoms of nonclassic CAH when a baby is born. Some people with nonclassic CAH never have symptoms. The condition is not found on routine infant blood screening tests. If symptoms occur, they usually appear in late childhood or early adulthood. Females who have nonclassic CAH may have genitals that look typical at birth. Later in life, they may have: Irregular menstrual periods, or none at all. Trouble getting pregnant. Features such as facial hair, more body hair than usual and a deeper voice. Sometimes, nonclassic CAH may be confused with a hormonal condition that happens during the reproductive years called polycystic ovary syndrome. Nonclassic CAH symptoms in children of either birth sex also can include: Symptoms of early puberty, such as growth of pubic hair sooner than usual. Serious acne. Rapid growth during childhood with bones that are more developed than is typical. Shorter than expected final height. When to see a doctor Most often, classic CAH is found at birth through routine newborn screening tests. Or it's found when a baby's outer genitals do not look typical. CAH also may be detected when infants show symptoms of serious illness due to low levels of cortisol, aldosterone or both. In children who have nonclassic CAH , symptoms of early puberty may appear. If you have concerns about your child's growth or development, schedule a checkup with your child's healthcare professional. In older people who have irregular periods, trouble getting pregnant or both, screening for CAH may be appropriate. If you are planning pregnancy or are pregnant and may be at risk of CAH , ask your healthcare professional about genetic counseling. A genetic counselor can tell you if your genes might affect you or any children you decide to have. Request an appointment"

Concussion,"The symptoms of a concussion can be subtle and may not occur right away. Symptoms can last for days, weeks or even longer. Common symptoms after a mild traumatic brain injury are headache, confusion and loss of memory, known as amnesia. The amnesia usually involves forgetting the event that caused the concussion. Physical symptoms of a concussion may include: Headache. Ringing in the ears. Nausea. Vomiting. Fatigue or drowsiness. Blurry vision. Other symptoms of a concussion include: Confusion or feeling as if in a fog. Amnesia surrounding the event. Dizziness or ""seeing stars."" A witness may observe these symptoms in the person with a concussion: Temporary loss of consciousness, though this doesn't always occur. Slurred speech. Delayed response to questions. Dazed appearance. Forgetfulness, such as asking the same question over and over. Some symptoms of a concussion occur right away. But sometimes symptoms may not occur for days after the injury, such as: Trouble with concentration and memory. Irritability and other personality changes. Sensitivity to light and noise. Trouble with sleep. Feeling emotional or depressed. Changes in taste and smell. Symptoms in children Concussions can be hard to recognize in infants and toddlers because they can't describe how they feel. Concussion clues may include: Dazed appearance. Listlessness and tiring easily. Irritability and crankiness. Loss of balance and unsteady walking. Excessive crying. Change in eating or sleeping patterns. Lack of interest in favorite toys. Vomiting. When to see a doctor See a healthcare professional within 1 to 2 days if: You or your child experiences a head injury, even if emergency care isn't required. Children and adolescents need to see a healthcare professional trained in evaluating and managing pediatric concussions. Seek emergency care for an adult or child who experiences a head injury and any of these symptoms: Repeated vomiting or nausea. A loss of consciousness lasting longer than 30 seconds. A headache that gets worse over time. Fluid or blood draining from the nose or ears. Vision or eye changes. For example, the black parts of the eye, known as the pupils, may be bigger than usual or unequal sizes. Ringing in the ears that doesn't go away. Weakness in the arms or legs. Changes in behavior. Confusion or disorientation. For example, the person may not recognize people or places. Slurred speech or other changes in speech. Obvious changes to mental function. Changes in physical coordination, such as stumbling or clumsiness. Seizures or convulsions. Dizziness that doesn't go away or that goes away and comes back. Symptoms that worsen over time. Large head bumps or bruises, such as bruises around the eyes or behind the ears. It's especially important to seek emergency care if these symptoms appear in infants under 12 months of age. When symptoms occur in athletes Never return to play or vigorous activity immediately following a concussion. Experts recommend that adult, child and adolescent athletes with concussions not return to play on the same day as the injury. Even if a concussion is suspected, experts recommend not returning to activities that can put the athlete at risk of another concussion. Gradual return to learning and physical activity is individual and depends on the symptoms. It should always be supervised by a healthcare professional. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Kleptomania,"Kleptomania symptoms may include: Inability to resist powerful urges to steal items that you don't need Feeling increased tension, anxiety or arousal leading up to the theft Feeling pleasure, relief or satisfaction while stealing Feeling terrible guilt, remorse, self-loathing, shame or fear of arrest after the theft Return of the urges and a repetition of the kleptomania cycle Features People with kleptomania usually have these features or characteristics: Unlike most shoplifters, people with kleptomania don't compulsively steal for personal gain, on a dare, for revenge or out of rebellion. They steal simply because the urge is so powerful that they can't resist it. Episodes of kleptomania generally happen suddenly, without planning and without help from another person. Most people with kleptomania steal from public places, such as stores. Some may steal from friends or acquaintances, such as at a party. Often, the stolen items have no value to the person with kleptomania, and the person can afford to buy them. The stolen items are usually stashed away, never to be used. Items also may be donated, given away to family or friends, or even secretly returned to the place from which they were stolen. Urges to steal may come and go or may occur with greater or lesser intensity over the course of time. When to see a doctor If you can't stop shoplifting or stealing, seek medical advice. Many people who may have kleptomania don't want to seek treatment because they're afraid they'll be arrested or jailed. However, a mental health provider usually doesn't report your thefts to authorities. Some people seek medical help because they're afraid they'll get caught and have legal problems. Or they've already been arrested, and they're legally required to seek treatment. If a loved one has kleptomania If you suspect a close friend or family member may have kleptomania, gently raise your concerns with that person. Keep in mind that kleptomania is a mental health disorder, not a character flaw, so approach the person without judgment or blame. It may be helpful to emphasize these points: You're concerned because you care about the person's health and well-being. You're worried about the risks of compulsive stealing, such as being arrested, losing a job or damaging a valued relationship. You understand that, with kleptomania, the urge to steal may be too strong to resist just by ""putting your mind to it."" Treatments are available that may help to minimize the urge to steal and live without addiction and shame. If you need help preparing for this conversation, talk with your health care provider. Your provider may refer you to a mental health professional who can help you plan a way of raising your concerns without making your friend or relative feel defensive or threatened.

Compulsive sexual behavior,"Some signs that you may have compulsive sexual behavior include: You have repeated and intense sexual fantasies, urges, and behaviors that take up a lot of your time and feel as if they're beyond your control. You feel driven or have frequent urges to do certain sexual behaviors, feel a release of the tension afterward, but also feel guilt or deep regret. You've tried without success to reduce or control your sexual fantasies, urges or behavior. You use compulsive sexual behavior as an escape from other problems, such as loneliness, depression, anxiety or stress. You continue to engage in sexual behaviors in spite of them causing serious problems. These could include the possibility of getting or giving someone else a sexually transmitted infection, the loss of important relationships, trouble at work, financial issues, or legal problems. You have trouble making and keeping healthy and stable relationships. When to see a doctor Ask for help if you feel you've lost control of your sexual behavior, especially if your behavior causes problems for you or other people. Compulsive sexual behavior tends to get worse over time without treatment, so get help when you first notice a problem. As you decide whether to seek professional help, ask yourself: Can I manage my sexual impulses? Am I distressed by my sexual behaviors? Is my sexual behavior hurting my relationships, affecting my work or causing serious problems, such as getting arrested? Do I try to hide my sexual behavior? Getting help for compulsive sexual behavior can be difficult because it's such a deeply personal and private matter. Try to: Set aside any shame or embarrassment and focus on the benefits of getting treatment. Remember that you're not alone — many people struggle with compulsive sexual behavior. Mental health professionals are trained to be understanding and not judge people. But not all mental health providers are experienced in treating this condition. Look for a provider who has experience in diagnosing and treating compulsive sexual behavior. Keep in mind that what you say to a health care or mental health provider is private. But providers are required to make a report if you tell them that you're going to hurt yourself or someone else. They also are required to report if you give information about sexual abuse of a child or abuse or neglect of someone who is vulnerable, such as an elderly or disabled person. Ask for help right away Ask a health care provider for help right away if: You think you may hurt yourself or others because of uncontrolled sexual behavior. You feel like your sexual behavior is slipping out of control. You're thinking of taking your own life.

Hoarding disorder,"The first symptoms of hoarding disorder often appear during the teenage to early adult years. You may get and save too many items, gradually build up clutter in living spaces, and have difficulty getting rid of things. As you grow older, you may continue getting and holding onto things that you may never use and don't have space for. By middle age, the clutter can become overwhelming as symptoms become more severe and increasingly difficult to treat. Problems with hoarding gradually develop over time and tend to be a private behavior. You may avoid having family, friends or repair workers in your home. Often, major clutter has developed by the time it reaches the attention of others. Symptoms of hoarding disorder may include: Getting and keeping too many items that you may not have a need for right now and don't have space for. Ongoing difficulty throwing out or parting with your things, regardless of their actual value. Feeling a need to save these items and being upset by the thought of getting rid of them. Building up clutter to the point where you can't use rooms. Trying to be perfect and avoiding or delaying decisions. Problems with planning and organizing. Getting too many items and refusing to part with them results in: Disorganized piles or stacks of items, such as newspapers, clothes, paperwork, books or sentimental items. Items that crowd and clutter your walking spaces and living areas. Rooms can't be used for the intended purpose, such as not being able to sleep in your bed. Buildup of food or trash to large, unsanitary levels. Distress or problems functioning or keeping yourself, others and pets safe in your home. Conflict with others who try to reduce or remove clutter from your home. Relationship issues, avoiding social activities and employment problems. Difficulty organizing items and sometimes losing important items in the clutter. With hoarding disorder, items are usually saved because: You believe these items are unique or that you'll need them at some point in the future. You feel emotionally connected to items that remind you of happier times or represent beloved people or pets. You feel safe and comforted when surrounded by things. You don't want to waste anything. Hoarding disorder is different from collecting. People who have collections, such as stamps or model cars, carefully search out specific items, organize them and display their collections. Collections can be large, but they aren't usually cluttered. Also, they don't cause the distress and problems functioning that are part of hoarding disorder. Hoarding animals People who hoard animals may collect dozens or even hundreds of pets. Animals may be confined inside or outside. Because of the large numbers, these animals often aren't cared for properly. The health and safety of the person and the animals are often at risk because of unsanitary conditions. When to see a doctor If you or a loved one has symptoms of hoarding disorder, talk with a health care provider or a mental health provider with expertise in diagnosing and treating hoarding disorder as soon as possible. Some communities have agencies that help with hoarding problems. Check with the local or county government for resources in your area. As hard as it might be, if your loved one's hoarding disorder threatens health or safety, you may need to contact local authorities, such as police, fire, public health, child or elder protective services, or animal welfare agencies.

Many people feel itching, burning or tingling around the lips for a day or so before a small, hard, painful spot appears and blisters form. Blisters. Small fluid-filled blisters often form along the border of the lips. Sometimes they appear around the nose or cheeks or inside the mouth. Oozing and crusting. The small blisters may merge and then burst. This can leave shallow open sores that ooze and crust over. Symptoms vary, depending on whether this is your first outbreak or a recurrence. The first time you have a cold sore, symptoms may not start for up to 20 days after you were first exposed to the virus. The sores can last several days.

Hypothermia,"When the temperature starts to drop, the body can start to shiver. Shivering is the body's attempt to warm itself. It is an automatic defense against cold temperature. Symptoms of hypothermia include: Shivering. Slurred speech or mumbling. Slow, shallow breathing. Weak pulse. Clumsiness or lack of coordination. Drowsiness or very low energy. Confusion or memory loss. Loss of consciousness. In infants, bright red, cold skin. People with hypothermia usually aren't aware of their condition. The symptoms often begin gradually. Also, the confused thinking associated with hypothermia prevents self-awareness. The confused thinking also can lead to risk-taking behavior. When to see a doctor Call 911 or your local emergency number if you suspect someone has hypothermia. While waiting for emergency help to arrive, gently move the person inside if possible. Jarring movements can trigger dangerous irregular heartbeats. Carefully remove any wet clothing and replace it with warm, dry coats or blankets. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Cold urticaria,
Valley fever,
Cluster headache,"Common symptoms Cluster headache Enlarge image Close Cluster headache Cluster headache Cluster headaches usually come close together in a group. Possible symptoms include severe pain in or around one eye or on one side of the head. There may be tears and a stuffy and runny nose on the side of the head that hurts. A cluster headache strikes quickly. There's usually no warning. But some people might first have migraine-like nausea and aura. Common symptoms during a cluster headache include: Extreme sharp or stabbing pain, usually in, behind or around one eye. The pain can spread to other areas of the face, head and neck. Pain on one side of the head in a single cluster. Pain can switch to the other side in another cluster. Restlessness. A lot of tears. Redness of the eye on the side that hurts. Stuffy or runny nose on the side that hurts. Forehead or facial sweating. Skin color changes on the side of the face that hurts. Swelling around the eye on the side that hurts. Drooping eyelid on the side that hurts. Because the pain of a cluster headache can be so bad, those who have one are likely to pace or sit and rock back and forth. Cluster periods A cluster period usually lasts for several weeks to months. Each cluster period may start at about the same time of year and last about the same length of time. For example, cluster periods can come during certain seasons, such as every spring or every fall. For most people with cluster headaches, the cluster period lasts from one week to a year. Then there's a pain-free period, known as remission, for three months or longer before the next cluster headache comes. This is known as episodic cluster headache. Cluster periods might go on for more than a year. Pain-free periods might last less than one month. If a cluster period lasts a year without letup, it's called chronic cluster headache. During a cluster period: Headaches usually come every day, often several times a day. A single attack can last from 15 minutes to three hours, but more often lasts 30 to 45 minutes. The attacks often occur at the same time each day. Most attacks occur at night, usually 1 to 2 hours after bedtime. The pain usually ends as suddenly as it begins. After attacks, most people are pain-free but exhausted. When to see a doctor See a health care provider if you've just started to have cluster headaches. Your provider can rule out other illnesses and suggest treatment. Even bad headache pain isn't usually the result of another disease. But headaches can sometimes mean a serious medical condition. This can include a brain tumor or tear of a weakened blood vessel, known as a dissection. Also, if you have a history of headaches, see your health care provider if there's a change in how they feel or how often they occur. Seek emergency care if you have any of these symptoms: A severe headache that comes on all of a sudden, often like a clap of thunder. A headache with a fever, nausea or vomiting, a stiff neck, confusion, seizures, numbness, or trouble speaking. These might point to a stroke, meningitis, encephalitis, a brain tumor or other problems. A headache after a head injury, especially if it gets worse — even if the injury was a minor fall or bump. A sudden, severe headache unlike any other. A headache that worsens over days and changes in pattern. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Depression (major depressive disorder),"Although depression may occur only once during your life, people typically have multiple episodes. During these episodes, symptoms occur most of the day, nearly every day and may include: Feelings of sadness, tearfulness, emptiness or hopelessness Angry outbursts, irritability or frustration, even over small matters Loss of interest or pleasure in most or all normal activities, such as sex, hobbies or sports Sleep disturbances, including insomnia or sleeping too much Tiredness and lack of energy, so even small tasks take extra effort Reduced appetite and weight loss or increased cravings for food and weight gain Anxiety, agitation or restlessness Slowed thinking, speaking or body movements Feelings of worthlessness or guilt, fixating on past failures or self-blame Trouble thinking, concentrating, making decisions and remembering things Frequent or recurrent thoughts of death, suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts or suicide Unexplained physical problems, such as back pain or headaches For many people with depression, symptoms usually are severe enough to cause noticeable problems in day-to-day activities, such as work, school, social activities or relationships with others. Some people may feel generally miserable or unhappy without really knowing why. Depression symptoms in children and teens Common signs and symptoms of depression in children and teenagers are similar to those of adults, but there can be some differences. In younger children, symptoms of depression may include sadness, irritability, clinginess, worry, aches and pains, refusing to go to school, or being underweight. In teens, symptoms may include sadness, irritability, feeling negative and worthless, anger, poor performance or poor attendance at school, feeling misunderstood and extremely sensitive, using recreational drugs or alcohol, eating or sleeping too much, self-harm, loss of interest in normal activities, and avoidance of social interaction. Depression symptoms in older adults Depression is not a normal part of growing older, and it should never be taken lightly. Unfortunately, depression often goes undiagnosed and untreated in older adults, and they may feel reluctant to seek help. Symptoms of depression may be different or less obvious in older adults, such as: Memory difficulties or personality changes Physical aches or pain Fatigue, loss of appetite, sleep problems or loss of interest in sex — not caused by a medical condition or medication Often wanting to stay at home, rather than going out to socialize or doing new things Suicidal thinking or feelings, especially in older men When to see a doctor If you feel depressed, make an appointment to see your doctor or mental health professional as soon as you can. If you're reluctant to seek treatment, talk to a friend or loved one, any health care professional, a faith leader, or someone else you trust. When to get emergency help If you think you may hurt yourself or attempt suicide, call 911 in the U.S. or your local emergency number immediately. Also consider these options if you're having suicidal thoughts: Call your doctor or mental health professional. Contact a suicide hotline.

Cleft lip and cleft palate,"Usually, a split (cleft) in the lip or roof of the mouth (palate) can be seen right away at birth. It may be found before birth during a prenatal ultrasound. Cleft lip and cleft palate may look like: A split in the lip and palate that affects one or both sides of the face. A split in the lip that appears as only a small notch in the lip or extends from the lip through the upper gum and palate into the bottom of the nose. A split in the roof of the mouth that doesn't affect how the face looks. Less often, a cleft occurs only in the muscles of the soft palate, which are at the back of the mouth and covered by the mouth's lining. This is called a submucous cleft palate. This type of cleft may not be seen at birth and may not be diagnosed until later when signs arise, such as: Having a hard time feeding. Nasal speaking voice. Constant ear infections. Rarely, having a hard time swallowing. Liquids or foods may come out of the nose. When to see a doctor A cleft lip and cleft palate may be seen at birth or may be found on ultrasound before birth. Your healthcare professional can start coordinating care at that time. If your baby has symptoms of a submucous cleft palate, make an appointment with your child's healthcare professional.

Color blindness,"You may have a color vision deficiency and not know it.

People affected by color blindness may not be able to distinguish: Different shades of red and green. Different shades of blue and yellow. Any colors. The most common color deficiency is an inability to see some shades of red and green. Often, a person who is red-green or blue-yellow deficient isn't completely insensitive to both colors. Defects can be mild, moderate or severe. When to see a doctor If you suspect you have problems distinguishing certain colors or your color vision changes, see an eye doctor for testing. It's important that children get comprehensive eye exams, including color vision testing, before starting school. There's no cure for inherited color deficiencies, but if illness or eye disease is the cause, treatment may improve color vision. Request an appointment"

Vulvodynia,"Vulva Enlarge image Close Vulva Vulva The vulva is the outer part of the female genitalia, including the labia majora, labia minora and clitoris. The main vulvodynia symptom is pain in the vulva, which includes the opening of the vagina. The pain often is described as: Burning. Irritation. Stinging. Rawness. Soreness. Sharp or knife-like pain. You also may feel aching, throbbing and swelling. How often the symptoms happen and where exactly they're felt varies from person to person. Your pain might be constant, or it may come and go. It might flare up only when the vulva is touched. You might feel the pain throughout your entire vulva. This is called generalized vulvodynia. Or the pain may flare up in a certain area, such as the tissue surrounding the opening of the vagina, called the vestibule. This is known as localized vulvodynia, and it's more common than the generalized kind. The tissue of the vulva might look slightly inflamed or swollen. More often, your vulva doesn't look different than usual. When to see a doctor If you have pain in your vulva, talk with your gynecologist or another member of your healthcare team. If you don't have a gynecologist, you might be referred to one. A healthcare professional needs to find out if your pain has a treatable cause that's different from vulvodynia, such as: An active infection from yeast or bacteria. A sexually transmitted disease such as herpes. An inflammatory skin condition. Vulvar growths. Genitourinary syndrome of menopause. Some people who don't realize they have vulvodynia try to ease their symptoms by using yeast infection treatments without a prescription. But it's key to get a checkup, so a member of your healthcare team can give you an exam and recommend the right treatment for you. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Symptoms of this form include depression, anxiety, impulsive behavior and aggression. The second form of CTE is thought to cause symptoms later in life, around age 60. These symptoms include memory and thinking problems that are likely to progress to dementia. The full list of signs to look for in people with CTE at autopsy is still unknown.

Hashimoto's disease,
Chronic kidney disease,"Signs and symptoms of chronic kidney disease develop over time if kidney damage progresses slowly. Loss of kidney function can cause a buildup of fluid or body waste or electrolyte problems.

Huntington's disease,"Huntington's disease usually causes movement disorders. It also causes mental health conditions and trouble with thinking and planning. These conditions can cause a wide spectrum of symptoms. The first symptoms vary greatly from person to person. Some symptoms appear to be worse or have a greater effect on functional ability. These symptoms may change in severity throughout the course of the disease. Movement disorders The movement disorders related to Huntington's disease may cause movements that can't be controlled, called chorea. Chorea are involuntary movements affecting all the muscles of the body, specifically the arms and legs, the face and the tongue. They also can affect the ability to make voluntary movements. Symptoms may include: Involuntary jerking or writhing movements. Muscle rigidity or muscle contracture. Slow or unusual eye movements. Trouble walking or keeping posture and balance. Trouble with speech or swallowing. People with Huntington's disease also may not be able to control voluntary movements. This can have a greater impact than the involuntary movements caused by the disease. Having trouble with voluntary movements can affect a person's ability to work, perform daily activities, communicate and remain independent. Cognitive conditions Huntington's disease often causes trouble with cognitive skills. These symptoms may include: Trouble organizing, prioritizing or focusing on tasks. Lack of flexibility or getting stuck on a thought, behavior or action, known as perseveration. Lack of impulse control that can result in outbursts, acting without thinking and sexual promiscuity. Lack of awareness of one's own behaviors and abilities. Slowness in processing thoughts or ''finding'' words. Trouble learning new information. Mental health conditions The most common mental health condition associated with Huntington's disease is depression. This isn't simply a reaction to receiving a diagnosis of Huntington's disease. Instead, depression appears to occur because of damage to the brain and changes in brain function. Symptoms may include: Irritability, sadness or apathy. Social withdrawal. Trouble sleeping. Fatigue and loss of energy. Thoughts of death, dying or suicide. Other common mental health conditions include: Obsessive-compulsive disorder, a condition marked by intrusive thoughts that keep coming back and by behaviors repeated over and over. Mania, which can cause elevated mood, overactivity, impulsive behavior and inflated self-esteem. Bipolar disorder, a condition with alternating episodes of depression and mania. Weight loss also is common in people with Huntington's disease, especially as the disease gets worse. Symptoms of juvenile Huntington's disease In younger people, Huntington's disease begins and progresses slightly differently than it does in adults. Symptoms that may appear early in the course of the disease include: Behavioral changes Trouble paying attention. Sudden drop in overall school performance. Behavioral issues, such as being aggressive or disruptive. Physical changes Contracted and rigid muscles that affect walking, especially in young children. Slight movements that can't be controlled, known as tremors. Frequent falls or clumsiness. Seizures. When to see a doctor See your healthcare professional if you notice changes in your movements, emotional state or mental ability. The symptoms of Huntington's disease also can be caused by a number of different conditions. Therefore, it's important to get a prompt and thorough diagnosis.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis,"Primary sclerosing cholangitis is often diagnosed before symptoms appear when a routine blood test or an X-ray taken for an unrelated condition shows liver abnormalities. Early signs and symptoms often include: Fatigue Itching Yellow eyes and skin (jaundice) Abdominal pain Many people diagnosed with primary sclerosing cholangitis before they have symptoms continue to feel generally well for several years.

Chlamydia trachomatis,"Early-stage Chlamydia trachomatis infections often cause few symptoms. Even when symptoms occur, they're often mild. That makes them easy to overlook, which is why regular screening is important. Symptoms of Chlamydia trachomatis infection can include: Painful urination. Vaginal discharge. Discharge from the penis. Painful vaginal sex. Vaginal bleeding between periods and after sex. Testicular pain. Depending on a person's sexual activity, Chlamydia trachomatis can infect the eyes, throat or rectum. Eye infections, called conjunctivitis, cause the inside of the eyelid to be red and irritated. In the throat, an infection may have no symptoms, or a person may have a sore throat. An infection in the rectum may have no symptoms or may cause rectal pain, discharge or bleeding. When to see a doctor See your healthcare professional if you have a discharge from your vagina, penis or rectum, or if you have pain during urination. Also, see your healthcare team if you learn your sexual partner has chlamydia. Your healthcare professional will likely prescribe an antibiotic even if you have no symptoms.

Childhood obesity,"The symptoms of childhood obesity aren't clear-cut. Not all children who carry extra pounds are overweight. Some children have larger than average body frames. And it's typical for children to carry different amounts of body fat at the various stages of development. So you might not know if weight is a concern based on how your child looks. A measurement called the body mass index (BMI) helps healthcare professionals check for overweight status and obese status. A child's BMI is based on the child's weight and height compared with those of other children the same age and sex using growth charts. Speak with your child's healthcare professional about how your child's BMI fits with other clues of children's health. For instance, growth patterns, eating and activity habits, stress, sleep, and family history also play a key role in health. Other tests also can help your child's healthcare professional figure out if your child's weight might pose health risks. When to see a doctor If you're worried that your child is putting on too much weight, talk with your child's healthcare professional. Get a healthcare checkup right away if your child also has any of the following symptoms: Headaches that don't go away for a long time. High blood pressure. Extreme thirst and frequent urination. Breathing that starts and stops many times during sleep. Poor growth compared with other children of the same sex and age. Request an appointment"
Child abuse,
Chilblains,"Symptoms of chilblains include: Small, itchy areas on your skin, often on your feet or hands. Sores or blistering. Swelling. Pain or stinging. Changes in skin color. When to see a doctor Seek medical care for chilblains if you: Have symptoms that are long lasting or go away then flare. Think you might have an infection. Have symptoms that aren't improving after two weeks of home care. Have symptoms that extend into the warm season. Aren't sure whether you were in below-freezing temperatures, as you might have frostbite. Request an appointment"
Chickenpox,"The rash caused by chickenpox appears 10 to 21 days after you're exposed to the varicella-zoster virus. The rash often lasts about 5 to 10 days. Other symptoms that may appear 1 to 2 days before the rash include: Fever. Loss of appetite. Headache. Tiredness and a general feeling of being unwell. Once the chickenpox rash appears, it goes through three phases: Raised bumps called papules, which break out over a few days. Small fluid-filled blisters called vesicles, which form in about one day and then break and leak. Crusts and scabs, which cover the broken blisters and take a few more days to heal. New bumps keep showing up for several days. So you may have bumps, blisters and scabs at the same time. You can spread the virus to other people for up to 48 hours before the rash appears. And the virus stays contagious until all broken blisters have crusted over. The disease is by and large mild in healthy children. But sometimes, the rash can cover the whole body. Blisters may form in the throat and eyes. They also may form in tissue that lines the inside of the urethra, anus and vagina. When to see a doctor If you think you or your child might have chickenpox, call your health care provider. Often, chickenpox can be diagnosed with an exam of the rash and other symptoms. You may need medicines that can help fight off the virus or treat other health problems that can happen because of chickenpox. To avoid infecting others in the waiting room, call ahead for an appointment. Mention that you think you or your child may have chickenpox. Also, let your provider know if: The rash spreads to one or both eyes. The rash gets very warm or tender. This might be a sign that the skin is infected with bacteria. You have more serious symptoms along with the rash. Watch for dizziness, new confusion, fast heartbeat, shortness of breath, shakiness, loss of the ability to use muscles together, a cough that becomes worse, vomiting, stiff neck or a fever higher than 102 F (38.9 C). You live with people who've never had chickenpox and haven't gotten the chickenpox vaccine yet. Someone in your household is pregnant. You live with someone who has a disease or takes medicines that affect the immune system. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Costochondritis,
Chest pain,"Chest pain symptoms depend on the cause. Heart-related chest pain Chest pain is often related to heart disease. Chest pain symptoms due to a heart attack or another heart condition may include: Pressure, tightness, pain, squeezing or aching in the chest. Pain that spreads to the shoulder, arm, back, neck, jaw, teeth or upper belly. Shortness of breath. Fatigue. Heartburn or indigestion. Cold sweats. Lightheadedness. Fast heartbeat. Nausea. Other types of chest pain It can be hard to tell if chest pain is due to a heart condition or something else.

Pain that gets better or worse when you change body position. Pain that gets worse when you breathe deeply or cough. Tenderness when you push on your chest. Pain that continues for many hours or days. The classic symptoms of heartburn — a painful, burning sensation behind the breastbone — can be due to a health condition affecting the heart or the stomach. When to see a doctor If you have new or unexplained chest pain or think you're having a heart attack, call 911 or emergency medical help right away. Never ignore the symptoms of a heart attack. If you can't get an ambulance or emergency vehicle to come to you, have someone drive you to the nearest hospital. Drive yourself only if you have no other way to get there.

Drug addiction (substance use disorder),"Drug addiction symptoms or behaviors include, among others: Feeling that you have to use the drug regularly — daily or even several times a day Having intense urges for the drug that block out any other thoughts Over time, needing more of the drug to get the same effect Taking larger amounts of the drug over a longer period of time than you intended Making certain that you maintain a supply of the drug Spending money on the drug, even though you can't afford it Not meeting obligations and work responsibilities, or cutting back on social or recreational activities because of drug use Continuing to use the drug, even though you know it's causing problems in your life or causing you physical or psychological harm Doing things to get the drug that you normally wouldn't do, such as stealing Driving or doing other risky activities when you're under the influence of the drug Spending a good deal of time getting the drug, using the drug or recovering from the effects of the drug Failing in your attempts to stop using the drug Experiencing withdrawal symptoms when you attempt to stop taking the drug Recognizing unhealthy drug use in family members Sometimes it's difficult to distinguish normal teenage moodiness or anxiety from signs of drug use. Possible signs that your teenager or other family member is using drugs include: Problems at school or work — frequently missing school or work, a sudden disinterest in school activities or work, or a drop in grades or work performance Physical health issues — lack of energy and motivation, weight loss or gain, or red eyes Neglected appearance — lack of interest in clothing, grooming or looks Changes in behavior — major efforts to bar family members from entering the teenager's room or being secretive about going out with friends; or drastic changes in behavior and in relationships with family and friends Money issues — sudden requests for money without a reasonable explanation; or your discovery that money is missing or has been stolen or that items have disappeared from your home, indicating maybe they're being sold to support drug use Recognizing signs of drug use or intoxication Signs and symptoms of drug use or intoxication may vary, depending on the type of drug. Below you'll find several examples. Marijuana, hashish and other cannabis-containing substances People use cannabis by smoking, eating or inhaling a vaporized form of the drug. Cannabis often precedes or is used along with other substances, such as alcohol or illegal drugs, and is often the first drug tried. Signs and symptoms of recent use can include: A sense of euphoria or feeling ""high"" A heightened sense of visual, auditory and taste perception Increased blood pressure and heart rate Red eyes Dry mouth Decreased coordination Difficulty concentrating or remembering Slowed reaction time Anxiety or paranoid thinking Cannabis odor on clothes or yellow fingertips Major cravings for certain foods at unusual times Long-term use is often associated with: Decreased mental sharpness Poor performance at school or at work Ongoing cough and frequent lung infections K2, Spice and bath salts Two groups of synthetic drugs — synthetic cannabinoids and substituted or synthetic cathinones — are illegal in most states. The effects of these drugs can be dangerous and unpredictable, as there is no quality control and some ingredients may not be known. Synthetic cannabinoids, also called K2 or Spice, are sprayed on dried herbs and then smoked, but can be prepared as an herbal tea. A liquid form can be vaporized in electronic cigarettes. Despite manufacturer claims, these are chemical compounds rather than ""natural"" or harmless products. These drugs can produce a ""high"" similar to marijuana and have become a popular but dangerous alternative. Signs and symptoms of recent use can include: A sense of euphoria or feeling ""high"" Elevated mood An altered sense of visual, auditory and taste perception Extreme anxiety or agitation Paranoia Hallucinations Increased heart rate and blood pressure or heart attack Vomiting Confusion Violent behavior Substituted cathinones, also called ""bath salts,"" are mind-altering (psychoactive) substances similar to amphetamines such as ecstasy (MDMA) and cocaine. Packages are often labeled as other products to avoid detection. Despite the name, these are not bath products such as Epsom salts. Substituted cathinones can be eaten, snorted, inhaled or injected and are highly addictive. These drugs can cause severe intoxication, which results in dangerous health effects or even death. Signs and symptoms of recent use can include: Feeling ""high"" Increased sociability Increased energy and agitation Increased sex drive Increased heart rate and blood pressure Problems thinking clearly Loss of muscle control Paranoia Panic attacks Hallucinations Delirium Psychotic and violent behavior Barbiturates, benzodiazepines and hypnotics Barbiturates, benzodiazepines and hypnotics are prescription central nervous system depressants. They're often used and misused in search for a sense of relaxation or a desire to ""switch off"" or forget stress-related thoughts or feelings. Barbiturates. An example is phenobarbital. Benzodiazepines. Examples include sedatives, such as diazepam (Valium), alprazolam (Xanax), lorazepam (Ativan), clonazepam (Klonopin) and chlordiazepoxide (Librium). Hypnotics. Examples include prescription sleeping medicines such as zolpidem (Ambien) and zaleplon (Sonata). Signs and symptoms of recent use can include: Drowsiness Slurred speech Lack of coordination Irritability or changes in mood Problems concentrating or thinking clearly Memory problems Involuntary eye movements Lack of inhibition Slowed breathing and reduced blood pressure Falls or accidents Dizziness Meth, cocaine and other stimulants Stimulants include amphetamines, meth (methamphetamine), cocaine, methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta, others) and amphetamine-dextroamphetamine (Adderall XR, Mydayis). They're often used and misused in search of a ""high,"" or to boost energy, to improve performance at work or school, or to lose weight or control appetite. Signs and symptoms of recent use can include: Feeling of happy excitement and too much confidence Increased alertness Increased energy and restlessness Behavior changes or aggression Rapid or rambling speech Larger than usual pupils, the black circles in the middle of the eyes Confusion, delusions and hallucinations Irritability, anxiety or paranoia Changes in heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature Nausea or vomiting with weight loss Poor judgment Nasal congestion and damage to the mucous membrane of the nose (if snorting drugs) Mouth sores, gum disease and tooth decay from smoking drugs (""meth mouth"") Insomnia Depression as the drug wears off Club drugs Club drugs are commonly used at clubs, concerts and parties. Examples include methylenedioxymethamphetamine, also called MDMA, ecstasy or molly, and gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, known as GHB. Other examples include ketamine and flunitrazepam or Rohypnol — a brand used outside the U.S. — also called roofie. These drugs are not all in the same category, but they share some similar effects and dangers, including long-term harmful effects. Because GHB and flunitrazepam can cause sedation, muscle relaxation, confusion and memory loss, the potential for sexual misconduct or sexual assault is associated with the use of these drugs. Signs and symptoms of use of club drugs can include: Hallucinations Paranoia Larger than usual pupils Chills and sweating Involuntary shaking (tremors) Behavior changes Muscle cramping and teeth clenching Muscle relaxation, poor coordination or problems moving Reduced inhibitions Heightened or altered sense of sight, sound and taste Poor judgment Memory problems or loss of memory Reduced consciousness Increased or decreased heart rate and blood pressure Hallucinogens Use of hallucinogens can produce different signs and symptoms, depending on the drug. The most common hallucinogens are lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and phencyclidine (PCP). LSD use may cause: Hallucinations Greatly reduced perception of reality, for example, interpreting input from one of your senses as another, such as hearing colors Impulsive behavior Rapid shifts in emotions Permanent mental changes in perception Rapid heart rate and high blood pressure Tremors Flashbacks, a reexperience of the hallucinations — even years later PCP use may cause: A feeling of being separated from your body and surroundings Hallucinations Problems with coordination and movement Aggressive, possibly violent behavior Involuntary eye movements Lack of pain sensation Increase in blood pressure and heart rate Problems with thinking and memory Problems speaking Poor judgment Intolerance to loud noise Sometimes seizures or coma Inhalants Signs and symptoms of inhalant use vary, depending on the substance. Some commonly inhaled substances include glue, paint thinners, correction fluid, felt tip marker fluid, gasoline, cleaning fluids and household aerosol products. Due to the toxic nature of these substances, users may develop brain damage or sudden death. Signs and symptoms of use can include: Possessing an inhalant substance without a reasonable explanation Brief happy excitement Behaving as if drunk Reduced ability to keep impulses under control Aggressive behavior or eagerness to fight Dizziness Nausea or vomiting Involuntary eye movements Appearing under the influence of drugs, with slurred speech, slow movements and poor coordination Irregular heartbeats Tremors Lingering odor of inhalant material Rash around the nose and mouth Opioid painkillers Opioids are narcotic, painkilling drugs produced from opium or made synthetically. This class of drugs includes, among others, heroin, morphine, codeine, methadone, fentanyl and oxycodone. Sometimes called the ""opioid epidemic,"" addiction to opioid prescription pain medicines has reached an alarming rate across the United States. Some people who've been using opioids over a long period of time may need physician-prescribed temporary or long-term drug substitution during treatment. Signs and symptoms of narcotic use and dependence can include: A sense of feeling ""high"" Reduced sense of pain Agitation, drowsiness or sedation Slurred speech Problems with attention and memory Pupils that are smaller than usual Lack of awareness or inattention to surrounding people and things Problems with coordination Depression Confusion Constipation Runny nose or nose sores (if snorting drugs) Needle marks (if injecting drugs) When to see a doctor If your drug use is out of control or causing problems, get help. The sooner you seek help, the greater your chances for a long-term recovery. Talk with your health care provider or see a mental health provider, such as a doctor who specializes in addiction medicine or addiction psychiatry, or a licensed alcohol and drug counselor. Make an appointment to see a provider if: You can't stop using a drug You continue using the drug despite the harm it causes Your drug use has led to unsafe behavior, such as sharing needles or unprotected sex You think you may be having withdrawal symptoms after stopping drug use If you're not ready to approach a health care provider or mental health professional, help lines or hotlines may be a good place to learn about treatment. You can find these lines listed on the internet or in the phone book. When to seek emergency help Seek emergency help if you or someone you know has taken a drug and: May have overdosed Shows changes in consciousness Has trouble breathing Has seizures or convulsions Has signs of a possible heart attack, such as chest pain or pressure Has any other troublesome physical or psychological reaction to use of the drug Staging an intervention People struggling with addiction usually deny they have a problem and hesitate to seek treatment. An intervention presents a loved one with a structured opportunity to make changes before things get even worse and can motivate someone to seek or accept help. It's important to plan an intervention carefully. It may be done by family and friends in consultation with a health care provider or mental health professional such as a licensed alcohol and drug counselor, or directed by an intervention professional. It involves family and friends and sometimes co-workers, clergy or others who care about the person struggling with addiction. During the intervention, these people gather together to have a direct, heart-to-heart conversation with the person about the consequences of addiction. Then they ask the person to accept treatment.

During diaper changes, one hip may be less flexible than the other. In teenagers and young adults, hip dysplasia can cause painful complications such as osteoarthritis or a hip labral tear. This may cause activity-related groin pain. Sometimes, there might be a sensation of instability in the hip. Request an appointment"
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease,
Cystic fibrosis,"In the U.S., because of newborn screening, cystic fibrosis can be diagnosed within the first month of life, before symptoms develop. But people born before newborn screening became available may not be diagnosed until the symptoms of CF show up. CF symptoms vary, depending on which organs are affected and how severe the condition is. Even in the same person, symptoms may worsen or get better at different times. Some people may not have symptoms until their teenage years or adulthood. People who are not diagnosed until adulthood usually have milder symptoms and are more likely to have symptoms that aren't typical. These may include repeated bouts of an inflamed pancreas called pancreatitis, infertility and repeated bouts of pneumonia. People with CF have a higher than usual level of salt in their sweat. Parents often can taste the salt when they kiss their children. Most of the other symptoms of CF affect the respiratory system and digestive system. Respiratory symptoms In cystic fibrosis, the lungs are most commonly affected. The thick and sticky mucus that happens with CF clogs the tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs. This can cause symptoms such as: A cough that won't go away and brings up thick mucus. A squeaking sound when breathing called wheezing. Limited ability to do physical activity before tiring. Repeated lung infections. Irritated and swollen nasal passages or a stuffy nose. Repeated sinus infections. Digestive symptoms The thick mucus caused by cystic fibrosis can block tubes that carry digestive enzymes from the pancreas to the small intestine. Without these digestive enzymes, the intestines can't completely take in and use the nutrients in food. The result is often: Foul-smelling, greasy stools. Poor weight gain and growth. Blocked intestines, which is more likely to happen in newborns. Ongoing or severe constipation. Straining often while trying to pass stool can cause part of the rectum to stick out of the anus. This is called a rectal prolapse. When to see a doctor If you or your child has symptoms of cystic fibrosis — or if someone in your family has CF — talk with your healthcare professional about testing for the condition. Make an appointment with a doctor who has skills and experience in treating CF. CF requires regular follow-up with your healthcare professional, at least every three months. Call your healthcare professional if you have new or worsening symptoms, such as more mucus than usual or a change in the mucus color, lack of energy, weight loss, or severe constipation. Get medical care right away if you're coughing up blood, have chest pain or trouble breathing, or have severe stomach pain and bloating. Call 911 or your local emergency number or go to the emergency department at a hospital if: You're having a hard time catching your breath or talking. Your lips or fingernails turn blue or gray. Others notice that you're not mentally alert. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Cervical dystonia,
Earwax blockage,
Stroke,"If you or someone you're with may be having a stroke, pay attention to the time the symptoms began. Some treatments are most effective when given soon after a stroke begins. Symptoms of stroke include: Trouble speaking and understanding what others are saying. A person having a stroke may be confused, slur words or may not be able to understand speech. Numbness, weakness or paralysis in the face, arm or leg. This often affects just one side of the body. The person can try to raise both arms over the head.

Dermatitis herpetiformis Gluten intolerance can cause this blistery skin disease. The rash usually occurs on the elbows, knees, torso, scalp or buttocks. This condition is often associated with changes to the lining of the small intestine identical to those of celiac disease, but the skin condition might not cause digestive symptoms. Health care professionals treat dermatitis herpetiformis with a gluten-free diet or medicine, or both, to control the rash. When to see a doctor Consult your health care team if you have diarrhea or digestive discomfort that lasts for more than two weeks. Consult your child's health care team if your child: Is pale. Is irritable. Is failing to grow. Has a potbelly. Has foul-smelling, bulky stools. Be sure to consult your health care team before trying a gluten-free diet. If you stop or even reduce the amount of gluten you eat before you're tested for celiac disease, you can change the test results. Celiac disease tends to run in families. If someone in your family has the condition, ask a member of your health care team if you should be tested. Also ask about testing if you or someone in your family has a risk factor for celiac disease, such as type 1 diabetes. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Childhood apraxia of speech,"Children with childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) may have a variety of speech symptoms. Symptoms vary depending on a child's age and the severity of the speech problems. CAS can result in: Babbling less or making fewer vocal sounds than is typical between the ages of 7 to 12 months. Speaking first words late, typically after ages 12 to 18 months old. Using a limited number of consonants and vowels. Often leaving out sounds when speaking. Using speech that is hard to understand. These symptoms are usually noticed between ages 18 months and 2 years. Symptoms at this age may indicate suspected CAS . Suspected CAS means a child may potentially have this speech disorder. The child's speech development should be watched to determine if therapy should begin. Children usually produce more speech between ages 2 and 4. Signs that may indicate CAS include: Vowel and consonant distortions. Pauses between syllables or words. Voicing errors, such as ""pie"" sounding like ""bye."" Many children with CAS have trouble getting their jaws, lips and tongues to the correct positions to make a sound. They also may have a hard time moving smoothly to the next sound. Many children with CAS also have language problems, such as reduced vocabulary or trouble with word order. Some symptoms may be unique to children with CAS , which helps to make a diagnosis. However, some symptoms of CAS are also symptoms of other types of speech or language disorders. It's hard to diagnose CAS if a child has only symptoms that are found both in CAS and in other disorders. Some characteristics, sometimes called markers, help distinguish CAS from other types of speech disorders. Those associated with CAS include: Trouble moving smoothly from one sound, syllable or word to another. Groping movements with the jaw, lips or tongue to try to make the correct movement for speech sounds. Vowel distortions, such as trying to use the correct vowel but saying it incorrectly. Using the wrong stress in a word, such as pronouncing ""banana"" as ""BUH-nan-uh"" instead of ""buh-NAN-uh."" Using equal emphasis on all syllables, such as saying ""BUH-NAN-UH."" Separation of syllables, such as putting a pause or gap between syllables. Inconsistency, such as making different errors when trying to say the same word a second time. Having a hard time imitating simple words. Voicing errors, such as saying ""down"" instead of ""town."" Other speech disorders sometimes confused with CAS Some speech sound disorders often get confused with CAS because some of the symptoms may overlap. These speech sound disorders include articulation disorders, phonological disorders and dysarthria. A child with an articulation or phonological disorder has trouble learning how to make and use specific sounds. Unlike in CAS , the child doesn't have trouble planning or coordinating the movements to speak. Articulation and phonological disorders are more common than CAS . Articulation or phonological speech errors may include: Substituting sounds. The child might say ""fum"" instead of ""thumb,"" ""wabbit"" instead of ""rabbit"" or ""tup"" instead of ""cup."" Leaving out final consonants. A child with CAS might say ""duh"" instead of ""duck"" or ""uh"" instead of ""up."" Stopping the airstream. The child might say ""tun"" instead of ""sun"" or ""doo"" instead of ""zoo."" Simplifying sound combinations. The child might say ""ting"" instead of ""string"" or ""fog"" instead of ""frog."" Dysarthria is a speech disorder that occurs because the speech muscles are weak. Making speech sounds is hard because the speech muscles can't move as far, as quickly or as strongly as they do during typical speech. People with dysarthria may also have a hoarse, soft or even strained voice. Or they may have slurred or slow speech. Dysarthria is often easier to identify than CAS . However, when dysarthria is caused by damage to areas of the brain that affect coordination, it can be hard to determine the differences between CAS and dysarthria. Request an appointment"
Carpal tunnel syndrome,"Symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome usually start gradually and include: Tingling and numbness. Tingling and numbness may occur in the fingers or hand. Usually the thumb, index, middle and ring fingers are affected, but not the little finger. You might have a feeling like an electric shock in these fingers. These symptoms often occur while holding a steering wheel, phone or newspaper, or they may wake you from sleep. The sensation also can travel from the wrist up the arm. Many people ""shake out"" their hands to try to relieve their symptoms. The numb feeling may become constant over time. Weakness. People with carpal tunnel syndrome may experience weakness in the hand and drop objects. This may be due to numbness or to weakness of the thumb's pinching muscles, which also are controlled by the median nerve. When to see a doctor See your healthcare professional if you have symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome that interfere with your usual activities and sleep patterns. Permanent nerve and muscle damage can occur without treatment. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Carotid artery disease,"In its early stages, carotid artery disease often doesn't have symptoms. The condition might not be obvious until it's serious enough to deprive the brain of blood, causing a stroke or TIA . Symptoms of a stroke or TIA include: Sudden numbness or weakness in the face or limbs, often on one side of the body. Sudden trouble speaking and understanding speech. Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes. Sudden dizziness or loss of balance. Sudden, severe headache with no known cause. When to see a doctor Seek emergency care for any symptoms of a stroke. Even if they last only a short while and then you feel OK, see a health care provider right away. You might have had a TIA . A TIA puts you at risk of a stroke. Talk to your health care provider if you have risk factors for carotid artery disease even if you don't have symptoms. Managing the risk factors might protect you from a stroke. Seeing a provider early increases your chances of finding carotid artery disease and getting treatment before a stroke occurs. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Heart disease,"Heart disease symptoms depend on the type of heart disease. Symptoms of heart disease in the blood vessels Coronary artery disease is a common heart condition that affects the major blood vessels that supply the heart muscle. A buildup of fats, cholesterol and other substances in and on the artery walls usually causes coronary artery disease. This buildup is called plaque. The buildup of plaque in the arteries is called atherosclerosis (ath-ur-o-skluh-ROE-sis). Atherosclerosis reduces blood flow to the heart and other parts of the body. It can lead to a heart attack, chest pain or a stroke. Symptoms of coronary artery disease can include: Chest pain, chest tightness, chest pressure and chest discomfort, called angina. Shortness of breath. Pain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper belly or back. Pain, numbness, weakness or coldness in the legs or arms if the blood vessels in those body areas are narrowed. You might not be diagnosed with coronary artery disease until you have a heart attack, angina, a stroke or heart failure. It's important to watch for heart symptoms. Talk with your healthcare team about any concerns. Heart disease can sometimes be found early with regular health checkups. What is coronary artery disease? A Mayo Clinic cardiologist explains. Stephen Kopecky, M.D., talks about the risk factors, symptoms and treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD). Learn how lifestyle changes can lower your risk. Show transcript for video What is coronary artery disease? A Mayo Clinic cardiologist explains. {Music playing} Stephen Kopecky, M.D., Cardiovascular Disease, Mayo Clinic: I'm Dr. Stephen Kopecky, a cardiologist at Mayo Clinic. In this video, we'll cover the basics of coronary artery disease. What is it? Who gets it? The symptoms, diagnosis and treatment. Whether you're looking for answers for yourself or someone you love, we're here to give you the best information available. Coronary artery disease, also called CAD, is a condition that affects your heart. It is the most common heart disease in the United States. CAD happens when coronary arteries struggle to supply the heart with enough blood, oxygen and nutrients. Cholesterol deposits, or plaques, are almost always to blame. These buildups narrow your arteries, decreasing blood flow to your heart. This can cause chest pain, shortness of breath or even a heart attack. CAD typically takes a long time to develop. So often, patients don't know that they have it until there's a problem. But there are ways to prevent coronary artery disease, and ways to know if you're at risk and ways to treat it. Who gets it? Anyone can develop CAD . It begins when fats, cholesterols and other substances gather along the walls of your arteries. This process is called atherosclerosis. It's typically no cause for concern. However, too much buildup can lead to a blockage, obstructing blood flow. There are a number of risk factors, common red flags, that can contribute to this and ultimately lead to coronary artery disease. First, getting older can mean more damaged and narrowed arteries. Second, men are generally at a greater risk. But the risk for women increases after menopause. Existing health conditions matter, too. High blood pressure can thicken your arteries, narrowing your blood flow. High cholesterol levels can increase the rate of plaque buildup. Diabetes is also associated with higher risk, as is being overweight. Your lifestyle plays a large role as well. Physical inactivity, long periods of unrelieved stress in your life, an unhealthy diet and smoking can all increase your risk. And finally, family history. If a close relative was diagnosed at an early age with heart disease, you're at a greater risk. All these factors together can paint a picture of your risk for developing CAD . What are the symptoms? When coronary arteries become narrow, the heart doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood. Remember, unlike most pumps, the heart has to pump its own energy supply. It's working harder with less. And you may begin to notice these signs and symptoms of pressure or tightness in your chest. This pain is called angina. It may feel like somebody is standing on your chest. When your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs, you might develop shortness of breath or extreme fatigue during activities. And if an artery becomes totally blocked, it leads to a heart attack. Classic signs and symptoms of a heart attack include crushing, substernal chest pain, pain in your shoulders or arms, shortness of breath, and sweating. However, many heart attacks have minimal or no symptoms and are found later during routine testing. How is it diagnosed? Diagnosing CAD starts by talking to your doctor. They'll be able to look at your medical history, do a physical exam and order routine blood work. Depending on that, they may suggest one or more of the following tests: an electrocardiogram or ECG, an echocardiogram or soundwave test of the heart, stress test, cardiac catheterization and angiogram, or a cardiac CT scan. How is it treated? Treating coronary artery disease usually means making changes to your lifestyle. This might be eating healthier foods, exercising regularly, losing excess weight, reducing stress or quitting smoking. The good news is these changes can do a lot to improve your outlook. Living a healthier life translates to having healthier arteries. When necessary, treatment could involve drugs like aspirin, cholesterol-modifying medications, beta-blockers, or certain medical procedures like angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery. What now? Discovering you have coronary artery disease can be overwhelming. But be encouraged. There are things you can do to manage and live with this condition. Reducing cholesterol, lowering blood pressure, quitting tobacco, eating healthier, exercising and managing your stress can make a world of difference. Better heart health starts by educating yourself. So don't be afraid to seek out information and ask your doctors about coronary artery disease. If you'd like to learn even more about this condition, watch our other related videos or visit Mayoclinic.org. We wish you well. Heart disease symptoms caused by irregular heartbeats, called arrhythmias The heart may beat too quickly, too slowly or irregularly. Heart arrhythmia symptoms can include: Chest pain or discomfort. Dizziness. Fainting or almost fainting. Fluttering in the chest. Lightheadedness. Racing heartbeat. Shortness of breath. Slow heartbeat. Heart disease symptoms caused by congenital heart defects A congenital heart defect is a heart condition present at birth. Serious congenital heart defects usually are noticed soon after birth. Congenital heart defect symptoms in children could include: Blue or gray skin. Depending on skin color, these changes may be easier or harder to see. Swelling in the legs, belly area or areas around the eyes. In an infant, shortness of breath during feedings, leading to poor weight gain. Some congenital heart defects may not be found until later in childhood or during adulthood. Symptoms may include: Getting very short of breath during exercise or activity. Easily tiring during exercise or activity. Swelling of the hands, ankles or feet. Heart disease symptoms caused by diseased heart muscle, called cardiomyopathy In the beginning, cardiomyopathy may not cause noticeable symptoms. As the condition gets worse, symptoms may include: Dizziness, lightheadedness and fainting. Fatigue. Feeling short of breath during activity or at rest. Feeling short of breath at night when trying to sleep, or waking up short of breath. Rapid, pounding or fluttering heartbeats. Swollen legs, ankles or feet. Heart disease symptoms caused by heart valve disease The heart has four valves. The valves open and close to move blood through the heart. Many things can damage the heart valves. If a heart valve is narrowed, it's called stenosis. If a heart valve lets blood flow backward, it's called regurgitation. Symptoms of heart valve disease depend on which valve isn't working right. Symptoms may include: Chest pain. Fainting or almost fainting. Fatigue. Irregular heartbeats. Shortness of breath. Swollen feet or ankles. When to see a doctor Get emergency medical help if you have these heart disease symptoms: Chest pain. Shortness of breath. Fainting. Always call 911 or your local emergency number if you think you might be having a heart attack. If you think you may have symptoms of heart disease, make an appointment for a health checkup. Heart disease is easier to treat when found early. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Enlarged heart,
Cardiogenic shock,
Myocardial ischemia,
Sudden cardiac arrest,"Symptoms of sudden cardiac arrest are immediate and severe and include: Sudden collapse. No pulse. No breathing. Loss of consciousness. Sometimes other symptoms occur before sudden cardiac arrest. These might include: Chest discomfort. Shortness of breath. Weakness. Fast-beating, fluttering or pounding heartbeat called palpitations. But sudden cardiac arrest often occurs with no warning. When to see a doctor When the heart stops, the lack of oxygen-rich blood can quickly cause death or permanent brain damage. Call 911 or emergency medical services for these symptoms: Chest pain or discomfort. Feeling of a pounding heartbeat. Rapid or irregular heartbeats. Unexplained wheezing. Shortness of breath. Fainting or near fainting. Lightheadedness or dizziness. If you see someone who's unconscious and not breathing, call 911 or local emergency services. Then start CPR. The American Heart Association recommends doing CPR with hard and fast chest compressions. Use an automated external defibrillator, called an AED, if one is available. How to do CPR Do CPR if the person isn't breathing. Push hard and fast on the person's chest — about 100 to 120 pushes a minute. The pushes are called compressions. If you've been trained in CPR, check the person's airway. Then deliver rescue breaths after every 30 compressions. If you haven't been trained, just continue chest compressions. Allow the chest to rise completely between each push. Keep doing this until an AED is available or emergency workers arrive. Portable automated external defibrillators, called AEDs, are available in many public places, including airports and shopping malls. You also can buy one for home use. AEDs come with voice instructions for their use. They're programmed to allow a shock only when appropriate. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Oral thrush,"Children and adults Symptoms of oral thrush may include: Creamy white patches or spots on your tongue, inner cheeks and sometimes on the roof of your mouth, gums and tonsils. Slightly raised patches that look like cottage cheese. Redness, burning or soreness that may be serious enough to cause a hard time eating or swallowing. Slight bleeding if the patches or spots are rubbed or scraped. Cracking and redness at the corners of your mouth. A cottony feeling in your mouth. Loss of taste. Redness, irritation and pain under your dentures. In severe cases, usually related to cancer or a weakened immune system from HIV / AIDS , the patches or spots may spread downward into your esophagus — the long, muscular tube stretching from the back of your mouth to your stomach. This is called Candida esophagitis. If this occurs, you may have trouble swallowing and feel pain or feel as if food is getting stuck in your throat. Babies and breastfeeding mothers In addition to the distinctive white mouth spots, babies may have trouble feeding or be fussy and irritable. They can pass the infection to their mothers during breastfeeding. Then the infection may pass back and forth between the mother's nipples and the baby's mouth. Women whose breasts are infected with candida may have these symptoms: Unusually red, sensitive, cracked or itchy nipples. Shiny or flaky skin on the darker, circular area around the nipple, called the areola. Unusual pain during nursing or painful nipples between feedings. Stabbing pains deep within the breast. When to see a doctor If you or your child gets white patches or spots inside the mouth, see your medical or dental professional. Thrush is uncommon in healthy older children, teenagers and adults. So if you get thrush, see your healthcare professional to find out if you need to be checked for an underlying medical condition or another cause. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Skin cancer,"Where skin cancer develops Basal cell carcinoma on white skin Enlarge image Close Basal cell carcinoma on white skin Basal cell carcinoma on white skin Basal cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that most often develops on areas of skin exposed to the sun, such as the face. On white skin, basal cell carcinoma often looks like a bump that's skin-colored or pink. Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin Enlarge image Close Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin Sun-exposed areas such as the lips and ears are especially likely to develop squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Melanoma Enlarge image Close Melanoma Melanoma The first sign of melanoma is often a mole that changes size, shape or color. This melanoma shows color variations and an irregular border, both of which are melanoma warning signs. Merkel cell carcinoma Enlarge image Close Merkel cell carcinoma Merkel cell carcinoma Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare type of skin cancer. It most often appears as a bump on the face, heard or neck. Skin cancer develops primarily on areas of sun-exposed skin, including the scalp, face, lips, ears, neck, chest, arms and hands, and on the legs in women. But it can also form on areas that rarely see the light of day — your palms, beneath your fingernails or toenails, and your genital area. Skin cancer affects people of all skin tones, including those with darker complexions. When melanoma occurs in people with dark skin tones, it's more likely to occur in areas not normally exposed to the sun, such as the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Basal cell carcinoma signs and symptoms Basal cell carcinoma usually occurs in sun-exposed areas of your body, such as your neck or face. Basal cell carcinoma may appear as: A pearly or waxy bump A flat, flesh-colored or brown scar-like lesion A bleeding or scabbing sore that heals and returns Squamous cell carcinoma signs and symptoms Most often, squamous cell carcinoma occurs on sun-exposed areas of your body, such as your face, ears and hands. People with darker skin are more likely to develop squamous cell carcinoma on areas that aren't often exposed to the sun. Squamous cell carcinoma may appear as: A firm, red nodule A flat lesion with a scaly, crusted surface Melanoma signs and symptoms Melanoma can develop anywhere on your body, in otherwise normal skin or in an existing mole that becomes cancerous. Melanoma most often appears on the face or the trunk of affected men. In women, this type of cancer most often develops on the lower legs. In both men and women, melanoma can occur on skin that hasn't been exposed to the sun. Melanoma can affect people of any skin tone. In people with darker skin tones, melanoma tends to occur on the palms or soles, or under the fingernails or toenails. Melanoma signs include: A large brownish spot with darker speckles A mole that changes in color, size or feel or that bleeds A small lesion with an irregular border and portions that appear red, pink, white, blue or blue-black A painful lesion that itches or burns Dark lesions on your palms, soles, fingertips or toes, or on mucous membranes lining your mouth, nose, vagina or anus Signs and symptoms of less common skin cancers Other, less common types of skin cancer include: Kaposi sarcoma. This rare form of skin cancer develops in the skin's blood vessels and causes red or purple patches on the skin or mucous membranes. Kaposi sarcoma mainly occurs in people with weakened immune systems, such as people with AIDS, and in people taking medications that suppress their natural immunity, such as people who've undergone organ transplants. Other people with an increased risk of Kaposi sarcoma include young men living in Africa or older men of Italian or Eastern European Jewish heritage. Merkel cell carcinoma. Merkel cell carcinoma causes firm, shiny nodules that occur on or just beneath the skin and in hair follicles. Merkel cell carcinoma is most often found on the head, neck and trunk. Sebaceous gland carcinoma. This uncommon and aggressive cancer originates in the oil glands in the skin. Sebaceous gland carcinomas — which usually appear as hard, painless nodules — can develop anywhere, but most occur on the eyelid, where they're frequently mistaken for other eyelid problems.

Paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system,"Symptoms of paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system can develop relatively quickly, often over days to weeks. They often begin even before a cancer is diagnosed. Symptoms vary depending on the body part being injured, and may include: Trouble walking. Trouble with balance. Loss of muscle coordination. Loss of muscle tone or weakness. Loss of fine motor skills, such as picking up objects. Trouble swallowing. Slurred speech or stuttering. Memory loss and other thinking impairment. Vision changes. Trouble sleeping. Seizures. Hallucinations. Movements that can't be controlled. Types of paraneoplastic syndromes Examples of paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system include: Cerebellar degeneration, also known as cerebellar ataxia. In this syndrome, loss of nerve cells occurs in the area of the brain called the cerebellum that controls muscle functions and balance. Symptoms may include trouble walking, lack of coordination in the arms and legs, trouble maintaining posture, and dizziness. They also may include nausea, eye movements that can't be controlled, double vision, trouble speaking or trouble swallowing. Limbic encephalitis. This syndrome involves swelling, known as inflammation, of an area of the brain known as the limbic system. The limbic system controls emotions, behaviors and certain memory functions. People with this condition may experience personality changes or mood changes, memory loss, seizures, hallucinations, or drowsiness. Encephalomyelitis. This syndrome refers to inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. There may be a wide variety of symptoms depending on the area affected. Opsoclonus-myoclonus. This syndrome occurs when the cerebellum or its connections don't work properly. It can cause rapid, irregular eye movements and muscle jerks in the arms, legs and trunk. Stiff person syndrome. Previously called stiff man syndrome, this syndrome leads to serious muscle stiffness, known as rigidity, that gets worse over time. Stiffness mainly affects the spine and legs. It also may cause painful muscle spasms. Myelopathy. This term refers to a syndrome that involves injury to the spinal cord. Symptoms depend on the level of spinal cord injury. Symptoms may include changes in bowel and bladder function, and weakness and numbness up to a certain level in the body. If the level of injury includes the neck, it can cause a serious disability that affects the arms and legs. Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. This syndrome is caused by disrupted communication between nerves and muscles. Symptoms include muscle weakness in the pelvis and legs, and fatigue. It also may cause trouble swallowing and speaking, irregular eye movement, and double vision. Other symptoms may include dry mouth and erectile dysfunction. When it occurs as a paraneoplastic syndrome, Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is typically associated with lung cancer. Myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis also is related to disrupted communication between nerves and muscles. People with myasthenia gravis have weakness and rapid fatigue of any of the muscles that are under voluntary control. These include muscles in the face, eyes, arms and legs. The muscles involved in chewing, swallowing, talking and breathing may be affected as well. When myasthenia gravis occurs as a paraneoplastic syndrome, it is typically associated with cancer of the thymus gland, known as thymoma. Neuromyotonia, also known as Isaacs' syndrome. Neuromyotonia occurs when there are an excess number of nerve impulses that control muscle movement. This is known as peripheral nerve hyperexcitability. These impulses can cause twitching, muscle rippling that looks like a ""bag of worms"" and stiffness that gets worse over time. It also may cause muscle cramps, slowed movement and other issues with the muscles. Peripheral neuropathy. In this condition, nerves that transmit messages from the brain or spinal column to the rest of the body are damaged. These nerves are known as peripheral nerves. When damage involves only the sensory nerves, it causes pain and changes in sensation anywhere in the body. Dysautonomia. Dysautonomia refers to a wide range of symptoms that result from injury to the nerves that regulate involuntary body functions. Known as the autonomic nervous system, these nerves control heart rate, blood pressure, sweating, and bowel and bladder functions. Symptoms may include low blood pressure, irregular heartbeats and trouble breathing. When to see a doctor Symptoms of paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system are similar to those of many conditions, including cancer, cancer complications and some cancer treatments. But if you have any symptoms suggesting a paraneoplastic syndrome, see your healthcare professional as soon as possible. Early diagnosis and appropriate care are important for treating the cancer and preventing further damage of the nervous system. Request an appointment"

Feeling a loss of control during binge eating. You may feel like you can't stop eating or can't control what you eat. Vomiting on purpose or exercising to extremes after binge eating so that you don't gain weight. Using medicines that make you urinate, called water pills or diuretics, or laxatives or enemas to pass stool when they're not needed.

This person can help you take the first steps to get help. Helping a loved one with bulimia symptoms If you think a loved one may have symptoms of bulimia, talk with the person openly and honestly about your concerns. You can't force someone to get help, but you can give encouragement and support. You also can help find a healthcare professional or mental health professional, make an appointment, and even offer to go along to the appointment. People with bulimia can be at any weight. For example, they could be average weight or overweight. That's why you can't tell just by looking at someone's size whether that person has bulimia.

Eating unusually large amounts of food over and over again in one sitting. Following a strict diet or fasting after binge eating.

Breast pain,"Breast pain can be cyclic or noncyclic. Cyclic means that the pain occurs on a regular pattern. Noncyclic means that the pain is constant, or that there's not a regular pattern. Each type of breast pain has distinct characteristics. Breast pain characteristics Cyclic breast pain Noncyclic breast pain Clearly related to the menstrual cycle and changing hormone levels Described as dull, heavy or aching Often accompanied by breast swelling, fullness or lumpiness Usually affects both breasts, particularly the upper, outer portions, and can radiate to the underarm Intensifies during the two weeks leading up to the start of the menstrual period, then eases up afterward More likely to affect people in their 20s and 30s, as well as people in their 40s who are transitioning to menopause Unrelated to the menstrual cycle Described as tight, burning, stabbing or aching sensation Constant or intermittent Usually affects one breast, in a localized area, but may spread more diffusely across the breast In women, most likely to occur after menopause Extramammary breast pain The term ""extramammary"" means ""outside the breast."" Extramammary breast pain feels like it starts in the breast tissue, but its source is actually outside the breast area. Pulling a muscle in the chest, for example, can cause pain in the chest wall or rib cage that spreads (radiates) to the breast. Arthritis that involves the cartilage in the chest, also known as costochondritis, can also cause pain. When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if breast pain: Continues daily for more than a couple of weeks Occurs in one specific area of your breast Seems to be getting worse over time Interferes with daily activities Awakens you from sleep Breast cancer risk is very low in people whose main symptom is breast pain, but if your doctor recommends an evaluation, it's important to follow through.

Sorry something went wrong with your subscription Please, try again in a couple of minutes Retry Causes Changing hormone levels can cause changes in the milk ducts or milk glands. These changes in the ducts and glands can cause breast cysts, which can be painful and are a common cause of cyclic breast pain. Noncyclic breast pain may be caused by trauma, prior breast surgery or other factors. Sometimes, it's not possible to identify the exact cause of breast pain, but some factors may increase the risk. Risk factors Breast pain is more common among people who haven't completed menopause, although it may occur after menopause. Breast pain can also occur in men who have gynecomastia, and in transgender people who are undergoing gender reassignment. Other factors that may increase the risk of breast pain include: Breast size. People who have large breasts may experience noncyclic breast pain related to the size of their breasts. Neck, shoulder and back pain may accompany breast pain that's caused by large breasts. Breast surgery. Breast pain associated with breast surgery and scar formation can sometimes linger after incisions have healed. Fatty acid imbalance. An imbalance of fatty acids within the cells may affect the sensitivity of breast tissue to circulating hormones. Medication use. Certain hormonal medications, including some infertility treatments and oral birth control pills, may be associated with breast pain. Breast tenderness is a possible side effect of estrogen and progesterone hormone therapies that are used after menopause. Breast pain may be associated with certain antidepressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants. Other medicines that can cause breast pain include those used to treat high blood pressure and some antibiotics. Excessive caffeine use. Although more research is needed, some people notice an improvement in breast pain when they reduce or eliminate caffeine. Prevention The following steps may help prevent the causes of breast pain, although more research is needed to determine their effectiveness. Avoid hormone therapy if possible. Avoid medications that are known to cause breast pain or make it worse. Wear a properly fitted bra, and wear a sports bra during exercise. Try relaxation therapy, which can help control the high levels of anxiety associated with severe breast pain. Limit or eliminate caffeine, a dietary change some people find helpful, although studies of caffeine's effect on breast pain and other premenstrual symptoms have been inconclusive. Avoid excessive or prolonged lifting activities . Follow a low-fat diet and eat more complex carbohydrates. Consider using an over-the-counter pain reliever, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) — but ask your doctor how much to take, as long-term use may increase your risk of liver problems and other side effects.

Breast cysts,"Breast cysts may be found in one or both breasts. Signs and symptoms of a breast cyst include: A smooth, easily movable round or oval lump that may have smooth edges — which typically, though not always, indicates it's benign Nipple discharge that may be clear, yellow, straw colored or dark brown Breast pain or tenderness in the area of the breast lump An increase in breast lump size and breast tenderness just before your period A decrease in breast lump size and resolution of other symptoms after your period Having breast cysts doesn't increase your risk of breast cancer. But having cysts may make it harder to find new breast lumps or other changes that might need evaluation by your doctor. Your breasts may feel lumpy and painful when you're menstruating, so it's important to be familiar with how your breasts feel throughout your menstrual cycle so that you'll know if something changes. When to see a doctor Normal breast tissue often feels lumpy or nodular. But if you feel a new breast lump that doesn't go away, gets bigger or persists after one or two menstrual cycles, see your doctor right away. Also see your doctor if you have new skin changes on one or both of your breasts."
Male breast cancer,"Signs and symptoms of male breast cancer can include: A painless lump or thickening of the skin on the chest.

Sorry something went wrong with your subscription Please, try again in a couple of minutes Retry Causes It's not clear what causes male breast cancer. Male breast cancer starts when cells in the breast tissue develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. In cancer cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. The changes tell the cancer cells to make many more cells quickly. Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells. The cancer cells might form a mass called a tumor. The tumor can grow to invade and destroy healthy body tissue. In time, cancer cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads, it's called metastatic cancer. Where breast cancer begins in men Everyone is born with a small amount of breast tissue. Breast tissue consists of milk-producing glands, ducts that carry milk to the nipples and fat. During puberty, people assigned female at birth typically begin growing more breast tissue. People assigned male at birth generally do not grow more breast tissue. But because everyone is born with a small amount of breast tissue, breast cancer can develop in anyone. Types of male breast cancer include: Cancer that begins in the milk ducts, called ductal carcinoma. This type of breast cancer starts in the tubes that connect to the nipple. These tubes are called ducts. Ductal carcinoma is the most common type of male breast cancer. Cancer that begins in the milk-producing glands, called lobular carcinoma. This type of cancer begins in the glands that have the potential to make breast milk. These glands are called lobules. Lobular carcinoma is less common in people assigned male at birth because they usually have fewer lobular cells. Other types of cancer. Other, rarer types of male breast cancer include Paget's disease of the nipple and inflammatory breast cancer. Risk factors Factors that increase the risk of male breast cancer include: Older age. The risk of breast cancer increases with age. Male breast cancer is most often diagnosed in men in their 60s. Hormone therapy for prostate cancer or medicines containing estrogen. If you take estrogen-related medicines, such as those used for hormone therapy for prostate cancer, your risk of breast cancer rises. Family history of breast cancer. If you have a blood relative with breast cancer, you have a greater chance of getting the disease. Inherited DNA changes that increase breast cancer risk. Some of the DNA changes that can lead to breast cancer are passed down from parents to children. People born with these DNA changes have a greater risk of breast cancer. For example, the DNA changes BRCA1 and BRCA2 increase the risk of male breast cancer. Klinefelter syndrome. This genetic syndrome occurs when males are born with more than one copy of the X chromosome. Klinefelter syndrome affects the development of the testicles. It causes changes in the balance of hormones in the body, which can increase the risk of male breast cancer. Liver disease. Certain conditions, such as cirrhosis of the liver, can change the balance of hormones in the body. This raises the risk of male breast cancer. Obesity. Obesity is linked with higher levels of estrogen in the body. This increases the risk of male breast cancer. Testicle disease or surgery. Having inflamed testicles, called orchitis, or surgery to remove a testicle, called orchiectomy, can increase the risk of male breast cancer. Prevention For most men, there's no way to prevent male breast cancer. For those that have an increased risk of cancer, there may be ways to lower the risk. If breast cancer runs in your family. Certain DNA changes are linked to breast cancer. If these DNA changes run in your family, you might have an increased risk of breast cancer. DNA changes that increase the risk of male breast cancer include BRCA1 and BRCA2. If you know that a blood relative carries DNA changes linked to breast cancer, tell your doctor or other health care professional. Together you can decide whether you should have genetic testing to see if you also carry the DNA changes. If you carry a DNA change that increases your risk, you might need breast cancer screening. Usually this involves becoming familiar with the skin and tissue on your chest. Tell your health professional if you notice any changes. You also might have an annual exam of your chest. If you're a transgender man. If you haven't had gender-affirming surgery on your chest, talk with your doctor or other health care professional about breast cancer screening. In general, follow the screening guidelines for people assigned female at birth. If you've had gender-affirming surgery to your chest, breast cancer is still possible, though it's rare. Often a small amount of breast tissue remains after surgery. Get to know the look and feel of the skin on your chest. Report any changes to your health care team right away.

Inflammatory breast cancer,"Inflammatory breast cancer doesn't commonly form a lump, as occurs with other forms of breast cancer. Instead, signs and symptoms of inflammatory breast cancer include: Fast change in the appearance of one breast, over the course of several weeks. Thickness, heaviness or swelling of one breast. Changes in skin color, giving the breast a red, purple, pink or bruised appearance. Unusual warmth of the affected breast. Dimpling or ridges on the skin of the affected breast, similar to an orange peel. Tenderness, pain or aching. Enlarged lymph nodes under the arm, above the collarbone or below the collarbone. Flattened nipple or nipple that turns inward on the affected breast. For inflammatory breast cancer to be diagnosed, these symptoms must have been present for less than six months. When to see a doctor Make an appointment with a doctor or other healthcare professional if you have any symptoms that worry you. Other, more common conditions have symptoms similar to those of inflammatory breast cancer. A breast injury or breast infection, called mastitis, may cause skin color changes, swelling and pain. Inflammatory breast cancer can easily be confused with a breast infection, which is much more common. It's reasonable and common to first be treated with antibiotics for a week or more. If your symptoms respond to antibiotics, additional testing isn't necessary. But if the condition does not improve, your healthcare professional may consider more-serious causes of your symptoms, such as inflammatory breast cancer. If you've been treated for a breast infection but your symptoms continue, contact your healthcare professional. You may have a mammogram or other test to evaluate your symptoms. The only way a healthcare professional can know whether your symptoms are caused by inflammatory breast cancer is to remove a sample of tissue for testing.

The lobes are further divided into smaller lobules that produce milk for breastfeeding. Small tubes, called ducts, conduct the milk to a reservoir that lies just beneath the nipple. Inflammatory breast cancer happens when cells in the breast develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. In cancer cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. The changes tell the cancer cells to make many more cells quickly. Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells. Most often the DNA changes happen in a cell in one of the tubes, called ducts, that can carry breast milk to the nipple. But the cancer also can begin with a cell in the glandular tissue, called lobules, where breast milk can be produced. In inflammatory breast cancer, the cancer cells break away from where they started. They travel to the lymphatic vessels in the breast skin. The cells grow to clog the vessels. The blockage in the lymphatic vessels causes skin color changes, swelling and dimpled skin. This skin is a classic sign of inflammatory breast cancer. Risk factors Factors that increase the risk of inflammatory breast cancer include: Being female Women are much more likely than men to get breast cancer, including inflammatory breast cancer. Everyone is born with some breast tissue, so anyone can get breast cancer. Being younger Inflammatory breast cancer is more frequently diagnosed in people in their 40s and 50s. Being Black Black people have a higher risk of inflammatory breast cancer than do white people. Being obese People who are obese have a greater risk of inflammatory breast cancer. Prevention Making changes in your daily life may help lower your risk of breast cancer. Try to: Ask about breast cancer screening Talk with your doctor or other healthcare professional about when to begin breast cancer screening. Ask about the benefits and risks of screening. Together, you can decide what breast cancer screening tests are right for you. Become familiar with your breasts through breast self-exam for breast awareness You may choose to become familiar with your breasts by occasionally inspecting them during a breast self-exam for breast awareness. If you find a new change, lumps or other unusual signs in your breasts, tell a healthcare professional right away. Breast awareness can't prevent breast cancer. But it may help you to better understand the look and feel of your breasts. This might make it more likely that you'll notice if something changes. Drink alcohol in moderation, if at all If you choose to drink, limit the amount of alcohol you drink to no more than one drink a day. For breast cancer prevention, there is no safe amount of alcohol. So if you're very concerned about your breast cancer risk, you may choose to not drink alcohol. Exercise most days of the week Aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise on most days of the week. If you haven't been active lately, ask your healthcare professional whether exercising is OK and start slowly. Limit hormone therapy during menopause Combination hormone therapy may increase the risk of breast cancer. Talk with a healthcare professional about the benefits and risks of hormone therapy. Some people have symptoms during menopause that cause discomfort. These people may decide that the risks of hormone therapy are acceptable to get relief. To reduce the risk of breast cancer, use the lowest dose of hormone therapy possible for the shortest amount of time. Maintain a healthy weight If your weight is healthy, work to maintain that weight. If you need to lose weight, ask a healthcare professional about healthy ways to lower your weight. Eat fewer calories and slowly increase the amount you exercise.

Breast cancer,"Nipple changes Enlarge image Close Nipple changes Nipple changes Breast and nipple changes can be a sign of breast cancer. Make an appointment with a healthcare professional if you notice any changes. Signs and symptoms of breast cancer may include: A breast lump or thickened area of skin that feels different from the surrounding tissue. A nipple that looks flattened or turns inward. Changes in the color of the breast skin. In people with white skin, the breast skin may look pink or red. In people with brown and Black skin, the breast skin may look darker than the other skin on the chest or it may look red or purple. Change in the size, shape or appearance of a breast. Changes to the skin over the breast, such as skin that looks dimpled or looks like an orange peel. Peeling, scaling, crusting or flaking of the skin on the breast. When to see a doctor If you find a lump or other change in your breast, make an appointment with a doctor or other healthcare professional. Don't wait for your next mammogram to see if the change you found is breast cancer. Report any changes in your breasts even if a recent mammogram showed there was no breast cancer.

Sorry something went wrong with your subscription Please, try again in a couple of minutes Retry Causes The exact cause of most breast cancers isn't known. Researchers have found things that increase the risk of breast cancer. These include hormones, lifestyle choices and things in the environment. But it's not clear why some people who don't have any factors get cancer, yet others with risk factors never do. It's likely that breast cancer happens through a complex interaction of your genetic makeup and the world around you. Healthcare professionals know that breast cancer starts when something changes the DNA inside cells in the breast tissue. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell a cell what to do. In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. In cancer cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. The changes tell the cancer cells to make many more cells quickly. Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells. The cancer cells might form a mass called a tumor. The tumor can grow to invade and destroy healthy body tissue. In time, cancer cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads, it's called metastatic cancer. The DNA changes that lead to breast cancer most often happen in the cells that line the milk ducts. These ducts are tubes designed to carry milk to the nipple. Breast cancer that starts in the ducts is called invasive ductal carcinoma. Breast cancer also can start in cells in the milk glands. These glands, called lobules, are designed to make breast milk. Cancer that happens in the lobules is called invasive lobular carcinoma. Other cells in the breast can become cancer cells, though this isn't common. Risk factors Factors that may increase the risk of breast cancer include: A family history of breast cancer. If a parent, sibling or child had breast cancer, your risk of breast cancer is increased. The risk is higher if your family has a history of getting breast cancer at a young age. The risk also is higher if you have multiple family members with breast cancer. Still, most people diagnosed with breast cancer don't have a family history of the disease. A personal history of breast cancer. If you've had cancer in one breast, you have an increased risk of getting cancer in the other breast. A personal history of breast conditions. Certain breast conditions are markers for a higher risk of breast cancer. These conditions include lobular carcinoma in situ, also called LCIS, and atypical hyperplasia of the breast. If you've had a breast biopsy that found one of these conditions, you have an increased risk of breast cancer. Beginning your period at a younger age. Beginning your period before age 12 increases your risk of breast cancer. Beginning menopause at an older age. Beginning menopause after age 55 increases the risk of breast cancer. Being female. Women are much more likely than men are to get breast cancer. Everyone is born with some breast tissue, so anyone can get breast cancer. Dense breast tissue. Breast tissue is made up of fatty tissue and dense tissue. Dense tissue is made of milk glands, milk ducts and fibrous tissue. If you have dense breasts, you have more dense tissue than fatty tissue in your breasts. Having dense breasts can make it harder to detect breast cancer on a mammogram. If a mammogram showed that you have dense breasts, your risk of breast cancer is increased. Talk with your healthcare team about other tests you might have in addition to mammograms to look for breast cancer. Drinking alcohol. Drinking alcohol increases the risk of breast cancer. Having your first child at an older age. Giving birth to your first child after age 30 may increase the risk of breast cancer. Having never been pregnant. Having been pregnant one or more times lowers the risk of breast cancer. Never having been pregnant increases the risk. Increasing age. The risk of breast cancer goes up as you get older. Inherited DNA changes that increase cancer risk. Certain DNA changes that increase the risk of breast cancer can be passed from parents to children. The most well-known changes are called BRCA1 and BRCA2. These changes can greatly increase your risk of breast cancer and other cancers, but not everyone with these DNA changes gets cancer. Menopausal hormone therapy. Taking certain hormone therapy medicines to control the symptoms of menopause may increase the risk of breast cancer. The risk is linked to hormone therapy medicines that combine estrogen and progesterone. The risk goes down when you stop taking these medicines. Obesity. People with obesity have an increased risk of breast cancer. Radiation exposure. If you received radiation treatments to your chest as a child or young adult, your risk of breast cancer is higher. Prevention Things you can do to lower your risk of breast cancer Breast self-exam Enlarge image Close Breast self-exam Breast self-exam To perform a breast self-exam for breast awareness, follow a pattern that ensures you cover your entire breast. For instance, imagine that your breasts are divided into equal wedges, like pieces of a pie. Move your fingers along each piece in toward your nipple. Making changes in your daily life may help lower your risk of breast cancer. Try to: Ask about breast cancer screening. Talk with your doctor or other healthcare professional about when to begin breast cancer screening. Ask about the benefits and risks of screening. Together, you can decide what breast cancer screening tests are right for you. Become familiar with your breasts through breast self-exam for breast awareness. You may choose to become familiar with your breasts by occasionally inspecting them during a breast self-exam for breast awareness. If there is a new change, a lump or something not typical in your breasts, report it to a healthcare professional right away. Breast awareness can't prevent breast cancer. But it may help you to better understand the look and feel of your breasts. This might make it more likely that you'll notice if something changes. Drink alcohol in moderation, if at all. Limit the amount of alcohol you drink to no more than one drink a day, if you choose to drink. For breast cancer prevention, there is no safe amount of alcohol. So if you're very concerned about your breast cancer risk, you may choose to not drink alcohol. Exercise most days of the week. Aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise on most days of the week.

If your weight is healthy, work to maintain that weight. If you need to lose weight, ask a healthcare professional about healthy ways to lower your weight. Eat fewer calories and slowly increase the amount of exercise. Medicines and operations for those with a high risk of breast cancer If you have a high risk of breast cancer, you might consider other options to lower the risk. You might have a high risk if you have a family history of breast cancer. Your risk also might be higher if you have a history of precancerous cells in the breast tissue. Talk about your risk with your healthcare team. Your team might have options for lowering your risk, such as: Preventive medicines. Using estrogen-blocking medicines can lower the risk of breast cancer in those who have a high risk. Options include medicines called selective estrogen receptor modulators and aromatase inhibitors. These medicines also are used as hormone therapy treatment for breast cancer. These medicines carry a risk of side effects. For this reason, they're only used in those who have a very high risk of breast cancer. Discuss the benefits and risks with your healthcare team. Preventive surgery. If you have a very high risk of breast cancer, you may consider having surgery to lower the risk of breast cancer. One option might be surgery to remove the breasts, called prophylactic mastectomy. Another option is surgery to remove the ovaries, called prophylactic oophorectomy. This operation lowers the risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer.

Brain tumor,"The signs and symptoms of a brain tumor depend on the brain tumor's size and location. Symptoms also might depend on how fast the brain tumor is growing, which is also called the tumor grade. General signs and symptoms caused by brain tumors may include: Headache or pressure in the head that is worse in the morning. Headaches that happen more often and seem more severe. Headaches that are sometimes described as tension headaches or migraines. Nausea or vomiting. Eye problems, such as blurry vision, seeing double or losing sight on the sides of your vision.

They might cause subtle symptoms that you don't notice at first. The symptoms might get worse over months or years. Cancerous brain tumors cause symptoms that get worse quickly. Cancerous brain tumors also are called brain cancers or malignant brain tumors. They cause symptoms that come on suddenly. They get worse in a matter of days or weeks. Brain tumor headaches Headaches are the most common symptom of brain tumors. Headaches happen in about half of people with brain tumors. Headaches can happen if a growing brain tumor presses on healthy cells around it. Or a brain tumor can cause swelling in the brain that increases pressure in the head and leads to a headache. Headache pain caused by brain tumors is often worse when you wake up in the morning. But it can happen at any time. Some people have headaches that wake them from sleep. Brain tumor headaches tend to cause pain that's worse when coughing or straining. People with brain tumors most often report that the headache feels like a tension headache. Some people say the headache feels like a migraine. Brain tumors in the back of the head might cause a headache with neck pain. If the brain tumor happens in the front of the head, the headache might feel like eye pain or sinus pain. Brain tumor symptoms by location Brain lobes Enlarge image Close Brain lobes Brain lobes Each side of the brain has four lobes. The frontal lobe is important for thinking and for managing voluntary movement or activity. The parietal lobe is involved in body temperature, taste, touch and movement. The occipital lobe is linked to vision. The temporal lobe processes memories, putting them with taste, sound, sight and touch. The main part of the brain is called the cerebrum. Brain tumors in different parts of the cerebrum might cause different symptoms. Brain tumors in the front of the brain. The frontal lobes are in the front of the brain. They control thinking and movement. Frontal lobe brain tumors might cause balance problems and trouble walking. There might be personality changes, such as forgetfulness and lack of interest in usual activities. Sometimes family members notice that the person with the brain tumor seems different. Brain tumors in the middle of the brain. The parietal lobes are in the upper middle part of the brain. They help process information about touch, taste, smell, vision and hearing. Parietal lobe brain tumors can cause problems related to the senses. Examples include vision problems and hearing problems. Brain tumors in the back of the brain. The occipital lobes are in the back of the brain. They control vision. Occipital lobe brain tumors can cause vision loss. Brain tumors in the lower part of the brain. The temporal lobes are on the sides of the brain. They process memories and senses. Temporal lobe brain tumors can cause memory problems.

Brain AVM (arteriovenous malformation),"A brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM) may not cause any symptoms until the AVM bursts and bleeds, known as a hemorrhage. In about half of all brain AVMs, a hemorrhage is the first sign of the malformation. But some people with brain AVMs may experience symptoms other than bleeding, such as: Seizures. Headaches or pain in one area of the head. Muscle weakness or numbness in one part of the body. Some people may experience more-serious symptoms depending on the location of the AVM, including: A very bad headache. Weakness, numbness or paralysis. Vision loss. Trouble speaking. Confusion or not being able to understand others. Trouble with walking. Symptoms of a brain AVM may begin at any age but usually appear between ages 10 and 40. Brain AVMs can damage brain tissue over time. The effects slowly build and often cause symptoms in early adulthood. By middle age, however, brain AVMs tend to remain stable and are less likely to cause symptoms. When to see a doctor Get medical care right away if you notice any symptoms of a brain AVM, such as seizures, headaches or other symptoms. A bleeding brain AVM is dangerous and requires emergency medical care. Request an appointment"

Brachial plexus injury,"Types of nerve damage Enlarge image Close Types of nerve damage Types of nerve damage Part of the spine (on left) shows how nerve roots connect to the spinal cord. The most serious types of nerve injuries are an avulsion (A), where the nerve roots are torn away from the spinal cord, and rupture (C), where the nerve is torn into two pieces. A less serious injury is stretching (B) of the nerve fibers. Symptoms of a brachial plexus injury can differ depending on how serious the injury is and where it's located. Usually only one arm is affected. Less severe injuries Minor damage often happens during contact sports, such as football or wrestling, when the brachial plexus nerves get stretched or squeezed together. These are called stingers or burners. Some of the symptoms are: A feeling like an electric shock or a burning sensation shooting down the arm. Numbness and weakness in the arm. These symptoms usually last only a few seconds or minutes, but in some people the symptoms may last for days or longer. More-serious injuries More-serious symptoms happen when an injury seriously damages or even tears or ruptures the nerves. The most serious brachial plexus injury is when the nerve root is cut or torn from the spinal cord. Symptoms of serious injuries can include: Weakness or not being able to use certain muscles in the hand, arm or shoulder. Loss of feeling in the arm, including the shoulder and hand. Intense pain. When to see a doctor Brachial plexus injuries can cause lasting weakness or disability. Even if yours seems minor, you may need medical care.

Intestinal obstruction,
Fecal incontinence,"The main symptom is not being able to control passing stool. This may happen during a short-term illness that causes diarrhea. For some people, fecal incontinence is an ongoing condition. There are two types of fecal incontinence: Urge incontinence is the sudden urge to pass stool but not being able to control the urge. The need to pass stool may come on so suddenly that it's not possible to get to the toilet in time. Passive incontinence is passing stool when a person isn't aware of the need to pass stool. A person may not be able to feel that the rectum is full of stool. Fecal incontinence also may be leakage of stool when a person passes gas. When to see a doctor See your healthcare professional if you or your child develops fecal incontinence. This is especially important if fecal incontinence: Happens often. Causes emotional distress. Affects your ability to do daily activities. Causes you to avoid time with family and friends. Often, people are embarrassed to talk about fecal incontinence.

Botulism,"Foodborne botulism Symptoms of foodborne botulism typically begin 12 to 36 hours after the toxin gets into your body. But depending on how much toxin you consumed, the start of symptoms may range from a few hours to a few days. Symptoms of foodborne botulism include: Trouble swallowing or speaking Dry mouth Facial weakness on both sides of the face Blurred or double vision Drooping eyelids Trouble breathing Nausea, vomiting and stomach cramps Paralysis Wound botulism Symptoms of wound botulism appear about 10 days after the toxin enters your body.

Blood in urine (hematuria),"Blood in the urine can look pink, red or cola-colored. Red blood cells cause the urine to change color. It takes only a small amount of blood to turn urine red. The bleeding often isn't painful. But if blood clots get passed in the urine, that can hurt. When to see a doctor See a health care provider whenever urine looks like it might have blood in it. Red urine isn't always caused by red blood cells. Some medicines can cause urine to turn red, such as a medicine called phenazopyridine that eases urinary tract symptoms. Certain foods also can turn urine red, including beets and rhubarb. It can be hard to tell whether a change of urine color is caused by blood. That's why it's always best to get a checkup.

You've had at least one manic episode that may come before or after hypomanic or major depressive episodes. In some cases, mania may cause a break from reality. This is called psychosis. Bipolar II disorder. You've had at least one major depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode. But you've never had a manic episode. Cyclothymia. You've had at least two years — or one year in children and teenagers — of many periods of hypomania symptoms and periods of depressive symptoms. These symptoms are less severe than major depression. Other types. These types include bipolar and related disorders caused by certain drugs or alcohol, or due to a medical condition, such as Cushing's disease, multiple sclerosis or stroke. These types may include mania, or hypomania, which is less extreme than mania, and depression. Symptoms can cause changes in mood and behavior that can't be predicted. This can lead to a lot of distress and cause you to have a hard time in life. Bipolar II disorder is not a milder form of bipolar I disorder. It's a separate diagnosis. While the manic episodes of bipolar I disorder can be severe and dangerous, people with bipolar II disorder can be depressed for longer periods of time. Bipolar disorder can start at any age, but usually it's diagnosed in the teenage years or early 20s. Symptoms can differ from person to person, and symptoms may vary over time. Mania and hypomania Mania and hypomania are different, but they have the same symptoms. Mania is more severe than hypomania. It causes more noticeable problems at work, school and social activities, as well as getting along with others. Mania also may cause a break from reality, known as psychosis. You many need to stay in a hospital for treatment. Manic and hypomanic episodes include three or more of these symptoms: Being much more active, energetic or agitated than usual. Feeling a distorted sense of well-being or too self-confident. Needing much less sleep than usual. Being unusually talkative and talking fast. Having racing thoughts or jumping quickly from one topic to another. Being easy to distract. Making poor decisions. For example, you may go on buying sprees, take sexual risks or make foolish investments. Major depressive episode A major depressive episode includes symptoms that are severe enough to cause you to have a hard time doing day-to-day activities. These activities include going to work or school, as well as taking part in social activities and getting along with others. An episode includes five or more of these symptoms: Having a depressed mood. You may feel sad, empty, hopeless or tearful. Children and teens who are depressed can seem irritable, angry or hostile. Having a marked loss of interest or feeling no pleasure in all or most activities. Losing a lot of weight when not dieting or overeating and gaining weight. When children don't gain weight as expected, this can be a sign of depression. Sleeping too little or too much. Feeling restless or acting slower than usual. Being very tired or losing energy. Feeling worthless, feeling too guilty or feeling guilty when it's not necessary. Having a hard time thinking or concentrating, or not being able to make decisions. Thinking about, planning or attempting suicide. Other features of bipolar disorder Symptoms of bipolar disorders, including depressive episodes, may include other features, such as: Anxious distress, when you're feeling symptoms of anxiety and fear that you're losing control. Melancholy, when you feel very sad and have a deep loss of pleasure. Psychosis, when your thoughts or emotions disconnect from reality. The timing of symptoms may be described as: Mixed, when you have symptoms of depression and mania or hypomania at the same time. Rapid cycling, when you have four mood episodes in the past year where you switch between mania and hypomania and major depression. Also, bipolar symptoms may happen when you're pregnant. Or symptoms can change with the seasons. Symptoms in children and teens Symptoms of bipolar disorder can be hard to identify in children and teens. It's often hard to tell whether these symptoms are the usual ups and downs or due to stress or trauma, or if they're signs of a mental health problem other than bipolar disorder. Children and teens may have distinct major depressive or manic or hypomanic episodes. But the pattern can vary from adults with bipolar disorder. Moods can shift fast during episodes. Some children may have periods without mood symptoms between episodes. The most noticeable signs of bipolar disorder in children and teenagers may be severe mood swings that aren't like their usual mood swings. When to see a doctor Despite their mood extremes, people with bipolar disorder often don't know how much being emotionally unstable disrupts their lives and the lives of their loved ones. As a result, they don't get the treatment they need. If you're like some people with bipolar disorder, you may enjoy the feelings of euphoria and cycles of being more productive. But an emotional crash always follows this euphoria. This crash can leave you depressed and worn out. It could cause you to have problems getting along with others. It also could leave you in financial or legal trouble. If you have any symptoms of depression or mania, see your healthcare or mental health professional. Bipolar disorder doesn't get better on its own. A mental health professional with experience in bipolar disorder can help you get your symptoms under control. When to get emergency help Thoughts about suicide and acting on these thoughts are common for people with bipolar disorder. If you're thinking about hurting yourself, or if you have a loved one who is in danger of suicide or attempting suicide, get help. You can let a family member or friend know, contact a suicide hotline, call 911 or your local emergency number, or go to the emergency department.

Binge-eating disorder,"If you have binge-eating disorder, you may be overweight or obese, or you may be at a healthy weight. Most people with binge-eating disorder feel upset about their body size or shape no matter what the number on the scale is. Symptoms of binge-eating disorder vary but can include: Feeling that you don't have control over your eating behavior, for example, you can't stop once you start. Often eating much larger than usual amounts of food in a specific amount of time, such as over a two-hour period. Eating even when you're full or not hungry. Eating very fast during eating binges. Eating until you're uncomfortably full. Often eating alone or in secret. Feeling depressed, disgusted, ashamed, guilty or upset about your eating. A person with bulimia nervosa, another eating disorder, may binge and then vomit, use laxatives or exercise excessively to get rid of extra calories. This is not the case with binge-eating disorder. If you have binge-eating disorder, you may try to diet or eat less food at mealtimes to compensate. But restricting your diet may simply lead to more binge eating. How much eating binges affect your mood and ability to function in daily life gives an idea of how serious the condition is for you. Binge-eating disorder can vary over time. The condition may be short-lived, may go away and come back, or may continue for years if left untreated. When to see a doctor If you have any symptoms of binge-eating disorder, get medical help as soon as possible. Talk with your healthcare professional or a mental health professional about your symptoms and feelings. If you're embarrassed by your eating and are worried about talking to your healthcare professional, start by talking with someone you trust about what you're going through. A friend, family member, teacher or faith leader can encourage and support you in taking the first steps to successful treatment of binge-eating disorder. Talking with a professional with specialty training in eating disorders or reaching out to an organization specializing in eating disorders might be a good place to find support from someone who understands what you're going through. Helping a loved one who has symptoms Someone who has binge-eating disorder may become an expert at hiding behavior. This is usually because of feelings of shame and embarrassment about the symptoms. Hiding symptoms can make it hard for others to notice the problem. If you think a loved one may have symptoms of binge-eating disorder, have an open and honest talk about your concerns, but remember to approach the topic with sensitivity. Eating disorders are mental health conditions, and the behaviors are not the fault or choice of the person with this condition. Give encouragement and support. Offer to help your loved one find a healthcare professional or mental health professional with experience in treating eating disorders. You may help make an appointment. You might even offer to go along. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Bee sting,"Bee sting symptoms can range from pain and swelling to a life-threatening allergic reaction. Having one type of reaction doesn't mean you'll always have the same reaction every time you're stung or that the next reaction will be more severe.  Mild reaction. Most of the time, bee sting symptoms are minor and include instant, sharp burning pain, a welt and swelling. In most people, the swelling and pain go away within a few hours. Moderate reaction. Some people who get stung by a bee or other insect have a stronger reaction, with burning pain, a welt, itching, flushing and swelling that gets worse over the next day or two. The symptoms can last up to seven days. Severe reaction. A severe reaction to a bee sting is potentially life-threatening and requires emergency treatment. This type of reaction is called anaphylaxis. A small percentage of people who are stung by a bee or other insect develop anaphylaxis. It usually happens 15 minutes to an hour after the sting. Symptoms include rash, itching, trouble breathing, swollen tongue, trouble swallowing and tightness in the chest. Multiple bee stings. If you get stung more than a dozen times, you can have a bad reaction that makes you feel quite sick. Symptoms include those of a moderate reaction as well as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever and lightheadedness. When to see a doctor Call 911 or seek immediate care for: A severe reaction to a bee sting that suggests anaphylaxis, even if it's just one or two symptoms. If you were prescribed emergency epinephrine that you inject yourself (EpiPen, Auvi-Q, others), use it right away as your healthcare professional directed. Inject the epinephrine first, then call 911. Multiple stings in children, older adults, and people who have heart or breathing problems. Make an appointment to see a healthcare professional if: Bee sting symptoms don't go away within three days. You've had other symptoms of an allergic response to a bee sting.

Autism spectrum disorder,"Some children show signs of autism spectrum disorder in early infancy, such as reduced eye contact, lack of response to their name or indifference to caregivers. Other children may develop normally for the first few months or years of life, but then suddenly become withdrawn or aggressive or lose language skills they've already acquired. Signs usually are seen by age 2 years. Each child with autism spectrum disorder is likely to have a unique pattern of behavior and level of severity — from low functioning to high functioning. Some children with autism spectrum disorder have difficulty learning, and some have signs of lower than normal intelligence. Other children with the disorder have normal to high intelligence — they learn quickly, yet have trouble communicating and applying what they know in everyday life and adjusting to social situations. Because of the unique mixture of symptoms in each child, severity can sometimes be difficult to determine. It's generally based on the level of impairments and how they impact the ability to function. Below are some common signs shown by people who have autism spectrum disorder. Social communication and interaction A child or adult with autism spectrum disorder may have problems with social interaction and communication skills, including any of these signs: Fails to respond to his or her name or appears not to hear you at times Resists cuddling and holding, and seems to prefer playing alone, retreating into his or her own world Has poor eye contact and lacks facial expression Doesn't speak or has delayed speech, or loses previous ability to say words or sentences Can't start a conversation or keep one going, or only starts one to make requests or label items Speaks with an abnormal tone or rhythm and may use a singsong voice or robot-like speech Repeats words or phrases verbatim, but doesn't understand how to use them Doesn't appear to understand simple questions or directions Doesn't express emotions or feelings and appears unaware of others' feelings Doesn't point at or bring objects to share interest Inappropriately approaches a social interaction by being passive, aggressive or disruptive Has difficulty recognizing nonverbal cues, such as interpreting other people's facial expressions, body postures or tone of voice Patterns of behavior A child or adult with autism spectrum disorder may have limited, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests or activities, including any of these signs: Performs repetitive movements, such as rocking, spinning or hand flapping Performs activities that could cause self-harm, such as biting or head-banging Develops specific routines or rituals and becomes disturbed at the slightest change Has problems with coordination or has odd movement patterns, such as clumsiness or walking on toes, and has odd, stiff or exaggerated body language Is fascinated by details of an object, such as the spinning wheels of a toy car, but doesn't understand the overall purpose or function of the object Is unusually sensitive to light, sound or touch, yet may be indifferent to pain or temperature Doesn't engage in imitative or make-believe play Fixates on an object or activity with abnormal intensity or focus Has specific food preferences, such as eating only a few foods, or refusing foods with a certain texture As they mature, some children with autism spectrum disorder become more engaged with others and show fewer disturbances in behavior. Some, usually those with the least severe problems, eventually may lead normal or near-normal lives. Others, however, continue to have difficulty with language or social skills, and the teen years can bring worse behavioral and emotional problems. When to see a doctor Babies develop at their own pace, and many don't follow exact timelines found in some parenting books. But children with autism spectrum disorder usually show some signs of delayed development before age 2 years. If you're concerned about your child's development or you suspect that your child may have autism spectrum disorder, discuss your concerns with your doctor. The symptoms associated with the disorder can also be linked with other developmental disorders. Signs of autism spectrum disorder often appear early in development when there are obvious delays in language skills and social interactions. Your doctor may recommend developmental tests to identify if your child has delays in cognitive, language and social skills, if your child: Doesn't respond with a smile or happy expression by 6 months Doesn't mimic sounds or facial expressions by 9 months Doesn't babble or coo by 12 months Doesn't gesture — such as point or wave — by 14 months Doesn't say single words by 16 months Doesn't play ""make-believe"" or pretend by 18 months Doesn't say two-word phrases by 24 months Loses language skills or social skills at any age Request an appointment There is a problem with

Atypical hyperplasia of the breast,"Atypical hyperplasia of the breast usually doesn't cause any symptoms. Atypical hyperplasia of the breast is typically found during a breast biopsy. A breast biopsy is a procedure to remove some breast cells for testing. It's often recommended if something concerning is found on a mammogram or an ultrasound. A biopsy also might be done to investigate a breast concern, such as a lump. When to see a doctor Make an appointment with a doctor or other healthcare professional if you have any symptoms that worry you.

Sorry something went wrong with your subscription Please, try again in a couple of minutes Retry Causes How breast cancer develops Enlarge image Close How breast cancer develops How breast cancer develops Ductal breast cancer is thought to begin with a growth of cells in a breast duct. A. A typical breast duct is shown. B. An overgrowth of cells may develop in the breast duct. This is called hyperplasia. C. Over time, the cells develop changes that make them look different from typical cells. This is called atypical hyperplasia. D. The atypical cells may continue to build up. The cells are trapped in the breast duct. This is called ductal carcinoma in situ. E. Eventually the cancer cells may break out of the duct and become invasive breast cancer. The cells can spread to other parts of the body. It's not clear what causes atypical hyperplasia of the breast. Atypical hyperplasia of the breast happens when cells in the breast tissue develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. The changes tell the cell to make many more cells. This causes a buildup of cells in the breast. Healthcare professionals call this buildup hyperplasia. The changes also turn the cells into atypical cells. This means that the cells look different from typical cells. Atypical hyperplasia is thought to be a very early step in the process that turns healthy cells into cancer cells. In theory, if atypical hyperplasia cells are allowed to continue growing, they could get more DNA changes and become cancer cells. More research is needed to understand how this happens. Atypical hyperplasia can happen in the breast ducts or the breast lobules: Atypical ductal hyperplasia describes a growth of atypical cells within the breast ducts. The breast ducts are tubes that can carry breast milk to the nipple. This type of atypical hyperplasia is most common. Atypical lobular hyperplasia describes a growth of atypical cells within the breast lobules. The breast lobules are glands that can make breast milk. This type of atypical hyperplasia is less common. Both types of atypical hyperplasia increase the risk of breast cancer. Treatment for both types is similar. Risk factors There are no specific risk factors for atypical hyperplasia of the breast. Atypical hyperplasia is one of several conditions that cause a growth of cells in the breast that isn't cancerous. These conditions are sometimes called benign breast diseases. Healthcare professionals have found risk factors for benign breast diseases. They include: A family history of breast cancer. If a parent, sibling or child had breast cancer, your risk of being diagnosed with atypical hyperplasia of the breast or another benign breast disease before menopause is increased. Menopausal hormone therapy. Taking certain hormone therapy medicines to control the symptoms of menopause may increase the risk of atypical hyperplasia and other benign breast diseases. Complications If you've been diagnosed with atypical hyperplasia of the breast, you have an increased risk of getting breast cancer in the future. The risk of breast cancer in those with atypical hyperplasia is about four times higher than in those who don't have atypical hyperplasia. The risk is similar for atypical ductal hyperplasia and atypical lobular hyperplasia. Studies of women with atypical hyperplasia have found that the risk of breast cancer increases over time. At 25 years after diagnosis, about 30% of women with atypical hyperplasia may have breast cancer. Put another way, for every 100 women diagnosed with atypical hyperplasia, 30 can be expected to have breast cancer 25 years after diagnosis. And 70 will not develop breast cancer. Prevention It's not clear whether there's anything that can prevent atypical hyperplasia of the breast. The same things that help lower the risk of breast cancer may help lower the risk of atypical hyperplasia. Things you can do to lower your risk of breast cancer include: Ask about breast cancer screening Talk with your doctor or other healthcare professional about when to begin breast cancer screening. Ask about the benefits and risks of screening. Together, you can decide what breast cancer screening tests are right for you. Become familiar with your breasts through breast self-exam for breast awareness You may choose to become familiar with your breasts by occasionally inspecting them during a breast self-exam for breast awareness. If there is a new change, a lump or something not typical in your breasts, report it to a healthcare professional right away. Breast awareness can't prevent breast cancer. But it may help you to better understand the look and feel of your breasts. This might make it more likely that you'll notice if something changes. Drink alcohol in moderation, if at all Limit the amount of alcohol you drink to no more than one drink a day, if you choose to drink. For breast cancer prevention, there is no safe amount of alcohol. So if you're very concerned about your breast cancer risk, you may choose to not drink alcohol. Exercise most days of the week Aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise on most days of the week. If you haven't been active lately, ask a healthcare professional whether it's OK and start slowly. Limit menopausal hormone therapy Hormone therapy treatments used to ease menopause symptoms may increase the risk of breast cancer. Talk with a healthcare professional about the benefits and risks of hormone therapy. Some people have symptoms during menopause that cause discomfort. These people may decide that the risks of hormone therapy are acceptable to get relief. To reduce the risk of breast cancer, use the lowest dose of hormone therapy possible for the shortest amount of time. Maintain a healthy weight If your weight is healthy, work to maintain that weight. If you need to lose weight, ask a healthcare professional about healthy ways to lower your weight. Eat fewer calories and slowly increase the amount of exercise. By Mayo Clinic Staff Request an appointment Diagnosis & treatment Sept. 19, 2024 Print Living with atypical hyperplasia of the breast?

Autoimmune pancreatitis,"Autoimmune pancreatitis, also called AIP, is difficult to diagnose. Often, it doesn't cause any symptoms. Symptoms of type 1 AIP are like those of pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer symptoms can include: Dark urine. Pale stools or stools that float in the toilet. Yellow skin and eyes, called jaundice. Pain in your upper belly or middle part of your back. Nausea and vomiting. Weakness or extreme tiredness. Loss of appetite or feelings of fullness. Weight loss for no known reason. The most common sign of type 1 AIP is painless jaundice. About 80% of people with type 1 AIP have painless jaundice. This is caused by blocked bile ducts. People with type 2 AIP can have repeat episodes of acute pancreatitis. Pain in the upper abdomen, a common symptom of pancreatic cancer, is often absent in autoimmune pancreatitis. Differences between type 1 and type 2 AIP are: In type 1 AIP , the disease may affect other organs in addition to the pancreas. Type 2 AIP affects only the pancreas. Type 2 disease also is associated with another autoimmune condition called inflammatory bowel disease. Type 1 AIP mostly affects men in the sixth to seventh decade of life. Type 2 AIP affects both men and women equally and has a younger age of onset compared with type 1 AIP . Type 1 AIP is more likely to relapse after treatment is discontinued. When to see a doctor Autoimmune pancreatitis often doesn't cause any symptoms. See a healthcare professional, however, if you have unexplained weight loss, belly pain, jaundice or other symptoms that bother you. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Exercise-induced asthma,
Occupational asthma,"Asthma attack Enlarge image Close Asthma attack Asthma attack If you have asthma, the inside walls of the airways in your lungs can become inflamed and swollen. In addition, membranes in your airway linings may secrete excess mucus. The result is an asthma attack. During an asthma attack, your narrowed airways make it harder to breathe and you may cough and wheeze. Occupational asthma symptoms may include: Wheezing. Coughing. Shortness of breath. Chest tightness. Other possible symptoms may include: Runny nose. Stuffy nose. Itchy or watery eyes. Occupational asthma symptoms depend on the substance you're exposed to, how long and how often you're exposed, and other factors. Your symptoms may: Begin right after exposure to a substance, later in the day or after work. Improve or go away on days off or during vacations and then return when you go to work. May begin early in the day and fail to improve on days off as disease progresses. May become permanent even after long periods away from work. When to see a doctor Seek medical treatment right away if your symptoms worsen. Severe asthma attacks can be life-threatening. Symptoms of an asthma attack that need emergency treatment include: Shortness of breath or wheezing that quickly gets worse. No easing of symptoms after using a quick-relief medicine. Shortness of breath even with little activity. Make an appointment to see your healthcare professional if you have breathing problems, such as coughing, wheezing or shortness of breath, especially if the symptoms don't go away or worsen.

Childhood asthma,
Asthma attack,"Symptoms of asthma attacks may include: Shortness of breath. Chest tightness or pain. Coughing. Wheezing. Severe symptoms also may include: Gasping for breath. Difficulty speaking because of shortness of breath. Straining of chest muscles to breathe. Worse symptoms when lying on the back. Severe sweating. The result of an at-home test, called a peak flow meter, can be an important sign of an asthma attack. This device measures how quickly you can force air out of your lungs. Peak flow readings are usually a percentage of how your lungs work at their best. This is called your personal best peak flow. An asthma action plan often includes steps to take based on a peak flow reading. A reading below 80% of a best peak flow can be a sign of an asthma attack. When to see a doctor An asthma action plan tells you when to call your healthcare professional and when to get emergency care. A plan has three parts with color codes: Green. The green zone of the plan is for times you are feeling well and have no asthma symptoms. The plan tells you what dose of long-term control medicine to take every day. It also tells you how many puffs of a quick-relief inhaler to take before you exercise. If you use a peak flow meter, readings should be 80% or higher of your best. Yellow. The yellow zone tells you what to do if you have asthma symptoms. It explains when to use a quick-relief inhaler and how many puffs to take. It also describes what to do if your symptoms don't improve and when to call your care team. Peak flow readings are 50% to 79% of your best. Red. The red zone tells you to get emergency care when symptoms are severe or if symptoms worsen or don't improve after using a quick-relief inhaler. Peak flow readings are below 50% of your personal best. If you do not have an asthma action plan, get emergency care if quick-relief medicine is not helping symptoms. Checkups for asthma control It's important to keep regular appointments with your healthcare professional. If your asthma is under control, you may be able to take lower doses of medicine. If you are using a rescue inhaler too often to treat asthma attacks, you may need changes to your asthma action plan. These might include taking a new medicine or higher doses of a medicine.

Asthma signs and symptoms include: Shortness of breath Chest tightness or pain Wheezing when exhaling, which is a common sign of asthma in children Trouble sleeping caused by shortness of breath, coughing or wheezing Coughing or wheezing attacks that are worsened by a respiratory virus, such as a cold or the flu Signs that your asthma is probably worsening include: Asthma signs and symptoms that are more frequent and bothersome Increasing difficulty breathing, as measured with a device used to check how well your lungs are working (peak flow meter) The need to use a quick-relief inhaler more often For some people, asthma signs and symptoms flare up in certain situations: Exercise-induced asthma, which may be worse when the air is cold and dry Occupational asthma, triggered by workplace irritants such as chemical fumes, gases or dust Allergy-induced asthma, triggered by airborne substances, such as pollen, mold spores, cockroach waste, or particles of skin and dried saliva shed by pets (pet dander) When to see a doctor Seek emergency treatment Severe asthma attacks can be life-threatening. Work with your doctor to determine what to do when your signs and symptoms worsen — and when you need emergency treatment. Signs of an asthma emergency include: Rapid worsening of shortness of breath or wheezing No improvement even after using a quick-relief inhaler Shortness of breath when you are doing minimal physical activity Contact your doctor See your doctor: If you think you have asthma. If you have frequent coughing or wheezing that lasts more than a few days or any other signs or symptoms of asthma, see your doctor.

Rheumatoid arthritis,"Signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis may include: Tender, warm, swollen joints Joint stiffness that is usually worse in the mornings and after inactivity Fatigue, fever and loss of appetite Early rheumatoid arthritis tends to affect your smaller joints first — particularly the joints that attach your fingers to your hands and your toes to your feet. As the disease progresses, symptoms often spread to the wrists, knees, ankles, elbows, hips and shoulders. In most cases, symptoms occur in the same joints on both sides of your body. About 40% of people who have rheumatoid arthritis also experience signs and symptoms that don't involve the joints. Areas that may be affected include: Skin Eyes Lungs Heart Kidneys Salivary glands Nerve tissue Bone marrow Blood vessels Rheumatoid arthritis signs and symptoms may vary in severity and may even come and go. Periods of increased disease activity, called flares, alternate with periods of relative remission — when the swelling and pain fade or disappear. Over time, rheumatoid arthritis can cause joints to deform and shift out of place. When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you have persistent discomfort and swelling in your joints. Rheumatoid arthritis Show transcript for video Rheumatoid arthritis Vivien Williams: Pain, swelling and stiffness in your joints — all are symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. But because these symptoms come and go, the condition can sometimes be tricky to diagnose. And it's important to get the right diagnosis because starting treatment early can make a difference. Virginia Wimmer, has rheumatoid arthritis: Give me your best shot! Ms. Williams: At first, Virginia Wimmer blamed her painful joints on too much volleyball. Ms. Wimmer: In my knees and in my wrists. Ms. Williams: For a couple years, she put up with the pain and swelling that would come and go. Then things got much worse. Ms. Wimmer: I couldn't have a ball touch my arms. Ms. Williams: She couldn't do much of anything, let alone play outside with her daughter. Ms. Wimmer: That was really hard. She'd have to beg me to play with her, and teach her, and help her. And I just had to sit and watch. Ms. Williams: Virginia was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. Nisha Manek, M.D., Rheumatology, Mayo Clinic: Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory condition. It's also associated with the immune system. Ms. Williams: Dr. Nisha Manek says it happens when the immune system becomes deregulated. You see, the joint capsule has a lining of tissue called the synovium. The synovium makes fluid that keeps joints lubricated. When you have rheumatoid arthritis, your immune system sends antibodies to the synovium and causes inflammation. This causes pain and joint damage, especially in small joints in the fingers and wrists. But it can affect any joint. The good news is that treatment for rheumatoid arthritis has improved dramatically over the last years. Medications, such as methotrexate, help bring the immune system back into balance and steroids can help calm flare-ups. So what was once an often crippling disease can now be controlled for many people — people like Virginia whose disease is pretty severe. Ms. Wimmer: You can get to the point where you are doing the things that you love and that is the goal. Ms. Williams: Dr. Manek says if you have pain, swelling and stiffness in your joints that comes and goes and is on both sides of your body, see your doctor to see if it is rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid is different than osteoarthritis which damages joints because of wear and tear. For Medical Edge, I'm Vivien Williams.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis,"The most common signs and symptoms of juvenile idiopathic arthritis are: Pain. While your child might not complain of joint pain, you may notice that he or she limps — especially first thing in the morning or after a nap. Swelling. Joint swelling is common but is often first noticed in larger joints such as the knee. Stiffness. You might notice that your child appears clumsier than usual, particularly in the morning or after naps. Fever, swollen lymph nodes and rash. In some cases, high fever, swollen lymph nodes or a rash on the trunk may occur — which is usually worse in the evenings. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis can affect one joint or many. There are several different subtypes of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, but the main ones are systemic, oligoarticular and polyarticular. Which type your child has depends on symptoms, the number of joints affected, and if a fever and rashes are prominent features. Like other forms of arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis is characterized by times when symptoms flare up and times when symptoms may be minimal. When to see a doctor Take your child to the doctor if he or she has joint pain, swelling or stiffness for more than a week — especially if he or she also has a fever. Request an appointment"

Arteriovenous malformation,"Symptoms of an arteriovenous malformation, also known as an AVM, can vary. Sometimes an AVM doesn't cause symptoms. The AVM can be found while getting images for another health concern. Often the first symptoms appear after bleeding occurs. Besides bleeding, symptoms can include: Trouble with thinking that gets worse over time. Headaches. Nausea and vomiting. Seizures. Loss of consciousness. Other possible symptoms include: Weak muscles, such as weakness in the legs. Loss of movement and feeling in one part of the body, known as paralysis. Loss of coordination that can cause trouble with walking. Trouble doing tasks that require planning. Back pain. Dizziness. Vision problems. This may include losing part of the field of vision, trouble moving the eyes or swelling of part of the optic nerve. Trouble with speech or understanding language. Numbness, tingling or sudden pain. Memory loss or dementia. Seeing or hearing things that aren't there, known as hallucinations. Confusion. Children and teens might have trouble with learning or behavior. One type of AVM called a vein of Galen malformation causes symptoms that appear at or shortly after birth. A vein of Galen malformation occurs deep inside the brain. Signs can include: A buildup of fluid in the brain that causes the head to be larger than usual. Swollen veins on the scalp. Seizures. Failure to thrive. Congestive heart failure.

Arteriovenous fistula,
Arteriosclerosis / atherosclerosis,"Mild atherosclerosis usually doesn't cause symptoms. Atherosclerosis symptoms usually don't happen until an artery is so narrowed or clogged that it can't send enough blood to organs and tissues. Sometimes a blood clot completely blocks blood flow. The clot may break apart. If this happens, it may cause a heart attack or stroke. Symptoms of moderate to severe atherosclerosis depend on which arteries are affected. For example, if you have atherosclerosis: In your heart arteries, you may have chest pain or pressure, called angina. In the arteries leading to your brain, you may have sudden numbness or weakness in your arms or legs, trouble speaking, slurred speech, sudden or temporary loss of vision in one eye, or drooping muscles in your face. These are symptoms of a transient ischemic attack (TIA). Untreated, a TIA can lead to a stroke. In the arteries in your arms and legs, you may have leg pain when walking, called claudication. This is a symptom of peripheral artery disease (PAD). You also might have lower blood pressure in the affected arm or leg. In the arteries leading to your kidneys, you may get high blood pressure or kidney failure. When to see a doctor If you think you have atherosclerosis, make an appointment for a health checkup. Early diagnosis and treatment can stop atherosclerosis from getting worse. Treatment may prevent a heart attack, stroke or another medical emergency. Get emergency medical help if you have chest pain or symptoms of transient ischemic attack or stroke such as: Sudden numbness or weakness in the arms or legs. Trouble speaking. Slurred speech. Sudden or temporary loss of vision in one eye. Drooping face muscles. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Heart arrhythmia,"A heart arrhythmia may not cause any symptoms. The irregular heartbeat may be noticed during a health checkup for another reason. Symptoms of an arrhythmia may include: A fluttering, pounding or racing feeling in the chest. A fast heartbeat. A slow heartbeat. Chest pain. Shortness of breath. Other symptoms may include: Anxiety. Feeling very tired. Lightheadedness or dizziness. Sweating. Fainting or almost fainting. When to see a doctor If you feel like your heart is beating too fast or too slow, or it's skipping a beat, make an appointment for a health checkup. You may be told to see a doctor trained in heart diseases, called a cardiologist. Get emergency medical care if you have these heart symptoms: Chest pain. Shortness of breath. Fainting. Always call 911 or your local emergency number if you think you might be having a heart attack. A type of arrhythmia called ventricular fibrillation can cause a dramatic drop in blood pressure. This can cause the person to fall to the ground within seconds, also called collapse. Soon the person's breathing and pulse will stop. Ventricular fibrillation is an emergency that needs immediate medical help. It's the most frequent cause of sudden cardiac death. If this happens, follow these steps: Call 911 or your local emergency number. If there's no one nearby trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), provide hands-only CPR . Push hard and fast on the center of the chest. Do 100 to 120 compressions a minute until medical help arrives. You do not need to breathe into the person's mouth. CPR helps keep blood flowing to the organs until an electrical shock can be given with an automated external defibrillator (AED). An AED is a device that delivers a shock to restart the heart. If an AED is available nearby, have someone get the device and follow the instructions. No training is required to use it. The device tells you what to do. It's programmed to allow a shock only when appropriate. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Chiari malformation,"Many people with Chiari malformation have no symptoms and don't need treatment. They learn they have Chiari malformation only when tests are performed for unrelated conditions. But some types of Chiari malfunction can cause symptoms. The more common types of Chiari malformation are: Type 1 Type 2 These types are less serious than the rarer pediatric form, type 3. But symptoms still can disrupt life. Chiari malformation type 1 In Chiari malformation type 1, symptoms usually appear during late childhood or adulthood. Bad headaches are the classic symptom of Chiari malformation. They generally occur after sudden coughing, sneezing or straining. People with Chiari malformation type 1 also can experience: Neck pain. Unsteady walk and trouble with balance. Poor hand coordination. Numbness and tingling of the hands and feet. Dizziness. Trouble swallowing. This sometimes happens with gagging, choking and vomiting. Speech changes, such as hoarseness. Less often, people with Chiari malformation may experience: Ringing or buzzing in the ears, known as tinnitus. Weakness. Slow heart rhythm. Curvature of the spine, known as scoliosis. The curvature is related to spinal cord impairment. Trouble with breathing. This includes central sleep apnea, which is when a person stops breathing during sleep. Chiari malformation type 2 In Chiari malformation type 2, a greater amount of tissue extends into the spinal canal compared with that in Chiari malformation type 1. Symptoms can include those related to a form of spina bifida called myelomeningocele. Chiari malformation type 2 nearly always occurs with myelomeningocele. In myelomeningocele, the backbone and the spinal canal don't close properly before birth. Symptoms may include: Changes in breathing pattern. Trouble swallowing, such as gagging. Quick downward eye movements. Weakness in the arms. Chiari malformation type 2 is usually noted with ultrasound during pregnancy. It also may be diagnosed after birth or in early infancy. Chiari malformation type 3 Chiari malformation type 3 is the most serious type of the condition. A portion of the lower back part of the brain, known as the cerebellum, or the brainstem extend through an opening in the skull. This form of Chiari malformation is diagnosed at birth or during pregnancy with an ultrasound. Chiari malformation type 3 causes brain and nervous system issues and has a higher rate of death. When to see a doctor See a health care professional if you or your child has any of the symptoms that may be associated with Chiari malformation. Many symptoms of Chiari malformation also can be caused by other conditions. A full medical evaluation is important. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Canker sore,"Most canker sores are round or oval with a white or yellow center and a red border. They form inside your mouth — on or under your tongue, inside your cheeks or lips, at the base of your gums, or on your soft palate. You might notice a tingling or burning sensation a day or two before the sores actually appear. There are several types of canker sores, including minor, major and herpetiform sores. Minor canker sores Minor canker sores are the most common and: Are usually small Are oval shaped with a red edge Heal without scarring in one to two weeks Major canker sores Major canker sores are less common and: Are larger and deeper than minor canker sores Are usually round with defined borders, but may have irregular edges when very large Can be extremely painful May take up to six weeks to heal and can leave extensive scarring Herpetiform canker sores Herpetiform canker sores are uncommon and usually develop later in life, but they're not caused by herpes virus infection. These canker sores: Are pinpoint size Often occur in clusters of 10 to 100 sores, but may merge into one large ulcer Have irregular edges Heal without scarring in one to two weeks When to see a doctor Consult your doctor if you experience: Unusually large canker sores Recurring sores, with new ones developing before old ones heal, or frequent outbreaks Persistent sores, lasting two weeks or more Sores that extend into the lips themselves (vermilion border) Pain that you can't control with self-care measures Extreme difficulty eating or drinking High fever along with canker sores See your dentist if you have sharp tooth surfaces or dental appliances that seem to trigger the sores.

Anxiety disorder due to a medical condition includes symptoms of intense anxiety or panic that are directly caused by a physical health problem. Generalized anxiety disorder includes persistent and excessive anxiety and worry about activities or events — even ordinary, routine issues. The worry is out of proportion to the actual circumstance, is difficult to control and affects how you feel physically. It often occurs along with other anxiety disorders or depression. Panic disorder involves repeated episodes of sudden feelings of intense anxiety and fear or terror that reach a peak within minutes (panic attacks). You may have feelings of impending doom, shortness of breath, chest pain, or a rapid, fluttering or pounding heart (heart palpitations). These panic attacks may lead to worrying about them happening again or avoiding situations in which they've occurred. Selective mutism is a consistent failure of children to speak in certain situations, such as school, even when they can speak in other situations, such as at home with close family members. This can interfere with school, work and social functioning. Separation anxiety disorder is a childhood disorder characterized by anxiety that's excessive for the child's developmental level and related to separation from parents or others who have parental roles. Social anxiety disorder (social phobia) involves high levels of anxiety, fear and avoidance of social situations due to feelings of embarrassment, self-consciousness and concern about being judged or viewed negatively by others. Specific phobias are characterized by major anxiety when you're exposed to a specific object or situation and a desire to avoid it. Phobias provoke panic attacks in some people. Substance-induced anxiety disorder is characterized by symptoms of intense anxiety or panic that are a direct result of misusing drugs, taking medications, being exposed to a toxic substance or withdrawal from drugs. Other specified anxiety disorder and unspecified anxiety disorder are terms for anxiety or phobias that don't meet the exact criteria for any other anxiety disorders but are significant enough to be distressing and disruptive. When to see a doctor See your doctor if: You feel like you're worrying too much and it's interfering with your work, relationships or other parts of your life Your fear, worry or anxiety is upsetting to you and difficult to control You feel depressed, have trouble with alcohol or drug use, or have other mental health concerns along with anxiety You think your anxiety could be linked to a physical health problem You have suicidal thoughts or behaviors — if this is the case, seek emergency treatment immediately Your worries may not go away on their own, and they may get worse over time if you don't seek help. See your doctor or a mental health provider before your anxiety gets worse. It's easier to treat if you get help early. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Social anxiety disorder (social phobia),"Feelings of shyness or discomfort in certain situations aren't necessarily signs of social anxiety disorder, particularly in children. Comfort levels in social situations vary, depending on personality traits and life experiences. Some people are naturally reserved and others are more outgoing. In contrast to everyday nervousness, social anxiety disorder includes fear, anxiety and avoidance that interfere with relationships, daily routines, work, school or other activities. Social anxiety disorder typically begins in the early to mid-teens, though it can sometimes start in younger children or in adults. Emotional and behavioral symptoms Signs and symptoms of social anxiety disorder can include constant: Fear of situations in which you may be judged negatively Worry about embarrassing or humiliating yourself Intense fear of interacting or talking with strangers Fear that others will notice that you look anxious Fear of physical symptoms that may cause you embarrassment, such as blushing, sweating, trembling or having a shaky voice Avoidance of doing things or speaking to people out of fear of embarrassment Avoidance of situations where you might be the center of attention Anxiety in anticipation of a feared activity or event Intense fear or anxiety during social situations Analysis of your performance and identification of flaws in your interactions after a social situation Expectation of the worst possible consequences from a negative experience during a social situation For children, anxiety about interacting with adults or peers may be shown by crying, having temper tantrums, clinging to parents or refusing to speak in social situations. Performance type of social anxiety disorder is when you experience intense fear and anxiety during speaking or performing in public but not in other types of more general social situations. Physical symptoms Physical signs and symptoms can sometimes accompany social anxiety disorder and may include: Blushing Fast heartbeat Trembling Sweating Upset stomach or nausea Trouble catching your breath Dizziness or lightheadedness Feeling that your mind has gone blank Muscle tension Avoiding common social situations Common, everyday experiences may be hard to endure when you have social anxiety disorder, including: Interacting with unfamiliar people or strangers Attending parties or social gatherings Going to work or school Starting conversations Making eye contact Dating Entering a room in which people are already seated Returning items to a store Eating in front of others Using a public restroom Social anxiety disorder symptoms can change over time. They may flare up if you're facing a lot of changes, stress or demands in your life. Although avoiding situations that produce anxiety may make you feel better in the short term, your anxiety is likely to continue over the long term if you don't get treatment. When to see a doctor See your doctor or a mental health professional if you fear and avoid normal social situations because they cause embarrassment, worry or panic.

Having problems with the law, including criminal behavior. Being hostile, aggressive, violent or threatening to others. Feeling no guilt about harming others.

Serious violation of rules. Antisocial personality disorder is considered a lifelong condition. But in some people, certain symptoms ― particularly destructive and criminal behavior ― may decrease over time. It's not clear whether this decrease is a result of the effect aging has on their mind and body, an increased awareness of the impact that antisocial behavior has had on their life, or other factors. When to see a doctor People with antisocial personality disorder are not likely to seek help on their own. If you suspect that a friend or family member may have the condition, you might gently suggest that the person seek help from a mental health provider and offer to help them find one.

Anorgasmia in women,"An orgasm is a peak feeling of intense pleasure in response to stimulating sexual activity. Vaginal penetration during sex indirectly stimulates the clitoris. But this may not be enough stimulation for orgasm. Many women may also need direct manual or oral stimulation of the clitoris to reach orgasm. Anorgasmia, or female orgasmic disorder, is defined as experiencing any of these in a significant way: Delayed orgasm. Absence of orgasm. Fewer orgasms. Less-intense orgasms. Anorgasmia can also be: Lifelong, if you've never had an orgasm. Acquired, if you have new problems with having orgasms. Situational, if you have problems with orgasm only in certain situations, with certain kinds of stimulation or with certain partners. Generalized, if you have problems with orgasm in any situation. Women who don't always reach orgasm during sexual encounters may not find it distressing. In that case, the lack of an orgasm is not considered a disorder. When to see a doctor Talk to your healthcare professional if you have concerns about your sex life, especially if you're concerned about your ability to have an orgasm.

Anorexia nervosa,"The physical and behavioral symptoms of anorexia nervosa relate to how starvation affects the brain. It may be hard to notice symptoms because what is seen as a low body weight differs for each person. Some people with anorexia may not look very thin. Also, people often hide their thinness, eating habits or physical problems. Physical symptoms Physical symptoms of anorexia nervosa may include irregular heart rhythms, low blood pressure and dehydration. Dehydration happens when your body doesn't have enough water and other fluids to carry out normal functions. Your fingers may look blue and you may have dry skin. You may notice a change in your skin color, such as yellowing of the skin. You may have hair that thins, breaks or falls out. You also may have soft, downy hair covering your body. Other physical symptoms include: Extreme weight loss or not making expected weight gains based on age. Being very tired and weak. Dizziness or fainting. Having a hard time passing stool and having stomach pain. Not able to stand the cold, or feeling cold when others feel fine. Swelling of the arms or legs. Wearing away of the teeth and calluses on your knuckles from causing yourself to vomit. Stomachaches. Never feeling hungry or feeling hungry and getting full right away after eating a very small portion. Having a hard time concentrating or focusing. Low mood. Increased anxiety. Stress fractures or reduced bone mass. If you're female and not taking a contraceptive, you may not have menstrual periods. Emotional and behavioral symptoms You may have an extreme focus on food. Sometimes this includes cooking meals for others but not eating those meals. You may skip meals or refuse to eat. You also may severely limit the amount of food you eat through dieting or fasting, not admit to being hungry, or make excuses for not eating. When you eat, you may eat only a few certain ""safe"" foods — often foods low in fat and calories. You also may focus too much on eating ""clean"" or healthy and stop eating specific types of food in a way that has not been recommended by a healthcare professional. You may take on rigid meal or eating habits, such as spitting out food after chewing. You may not want to eat in public. You also may lie about how much food you've eaten. You may have a type of anorexia where you binge and purge like with bulimia. Binges are when you feel like you can't control what or how much you eat. Binges can sometimes be large amounts of food. But overall, if you have the binge-purge type of anorexia, you eat much less than you need. Purges are when you make yourself vomit, or you misuse enemas, laxatives, diuretics, diet aids or herbal products to get rid of food that you ate. You lose too much weight and have very low body weight, compared with your personal weight history. Other emotional and behavioral symptoms of anorexia may include: Too much exercise. This includes exercising when you're injured, instead of doing something you value or enjoy, or exercising to such a degree of intensity that it's notably different from the people around you. Fear of weight gain. Being scared to gain weight may include the need to weigh or measure your body over and over again. Focus on appearance. This includes checking in the mirror often for what you think are flaws and wearing layers of clothing to cover up. Concern about being overweight. This includes concerns about being fat or having parts of the body that are fat. Emotional changes. You may lack emotion or feel emotionally flat. You may not want to be social. You also could be angry or irritable. You may have little interest in sex. Trouble sleeping. This also is known as insomnia. You also may hurt yourself. Or you may think or talk about suicide or attempt suicide. When to see a doctor Because of how malnutrition affects the brain, someone with anorexia may not want to be treated. A core feature of anorexia is that people with the eating disorder usually don't see how serious their symptoms are. This is because of the way anorexia affects the brain. If someone in your life has anorexia, it's better to take action — even if you think it could be an overreaction — rather than let symptoms continue. Early treatment of eating disorders leads to the best outcomes. If you're worried about a loved one, urge your loved one to talk to a healthcare professional. If you're a parent or caregiver who is concerned about your child's eating habits, weight or body image, share your concerns with your child's healthcare professional. If you think you have an eating disorder, get help. If you're thinking about suicide, contact a suicide hotline. In the U.S., call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline , available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Or use the Lifeline Chat . Services are free and confidential.

Angina,"Heart attack Enlarge image Close Heart attack Heart attack A heart attack occurs when an artery supplying the heart with blood and oxygen becomes blocked. Fatty deposits build up over time, forming plaques in the heart's arteries. If a plaque ruptures, a blood clot can form and block the arteries, causing a heart attack. During a heart attack, tissue in the heart muscle dies due to lack of blood flow through the heart's arteries. Angina symptoms include chest pain and discomfort. The chest pain or discomfort may feel like: Burning. Fullness. Pressure. Squeezing. Pain also may be felt in the arms, neck, jaw, shoulder or back. Other symptoms of angina include: Dizziness. Fatigue. Nausea. Shortness of breath. Sweating. The severity, duration and type of angina can vary. New or different symptoms may signal unstable angina or a heart attack. Any new or worsening angina symptoms need to be checked immediately by a healthcare professional. The healthcare team can determine whether you have stable or unstable angina. Angina in women Symptoms of angina in women can be different from the classic angina symptoms. These differences may lead to delays in seeking treatment. For example, chest pain may not be the only symptom or the most common symptom. Other symptoms of angina in women may include: Discomfort in the neck, jaw, teeth or back. Nausea. Shortness of breath. Stabbing pain instead of chest pressure. Stomach pain. When to see a doctor Chest pain that lasts longer than a few minutes and doesn't go away with rest or angina medicines may be due to a heart attack. Call 911 or emergency medical help. Only drive yourself to the hospital if there is no other way to get there. If chest discomfort is a new symptom for you, see a healthcare professional to determine the cause and to get proper treatment. If you have stable angina and it gets worse or changes, seek medical help immediately. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Brain aneurysms may be found during imaging tests that are done for other conditions. However, a ruptured aneurysm is a very serious condition, typically causing a severe headache. And if an unruptured aneurysm presses against brain tissue or nerves, it may cause pain and other symptoms. Ruptured aneurysm A sudden, severe headache is the key symptom of a ruptured aneurysm.

Mayo Clinic Minute: What is an aneurysm? Show transcript for video Mayo Clinic Minute: What is an aneurysm? Vivien Williams : An aneurysm is an abnormal bulge or ballooning in the wall of a blood vessel. Bernard Bendok, M.D., Neurosurgery, Mayo Clinic : A portion of these patients will go on to have a rupture. And the challenge with rupture is that it's unpredictable. Vivien Williams : Dr. Bernard Bendok says a ruptured aneurysm is a medical emergency that can cause life-threatening bleeding in the brain. Dr. Bendok : The typical presentation is somebody who has the worst headache of their life. Vivien Williams : Fast treatment is essential. It includes open surgery or less-invasive options, such as sealing the ruptured artery from within the blood vessel with metal coils and/or stents. Dr. Bendok says 1 to 2 percent of the population have aneurysms and only a small percentage of that group will experience a rupture. People who have a family history of aneurysms, have polycystic kidney disease, connective tissue disease, and people who smoke are at increased risk of rupture and should consider screening. If a rupture happens, fast treatment can save lives. For the Mayo Clinic News Network, I'm Vivien Williams. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Transient global amnesia,
Amnesia,"The two main features of amnesia are: Trouble learning new information. Trouble remembering past events and previously familiar information. Most people with amnesia have problems with short-term memory, so they can't retain new information. Recent memories are most likely to be lost. More-remote or deeply ingrained memories may be spared. For example, people may recall experiences from childhood or know the names of past presidents. But they may not be able to name the current president, know the month or remember what they ate for breakfast. Isolated memory loss doesn't affect a person's intelligence, general knowledge, awareness or attention span. It also doesn't affect judgment, personality or identity. People with amnesia usually can understand written and spoken words and can learn skills such as bike riding or piano playing. They may understand they have a memory disorder. Amnesia isn't the same as dementia. Dementia often includes memory loss but also involves other problems with thinking that lead to a decline in daily functioning. These problems include having trouble with language, judgment and visual-spatial skills. Memory loss also is a common symptom of mild cognitive impairment. This disorder involves memory and other cognitive problems that aren't as severe as those experienced in dementia. Additional symptoms Depending on the cause of the amnesia, other symptoms may include: False memories that are either completely invented or are real memories misplaced in time. Confusion or disorientation. When to see a doctor Anyone who experiences unexplained memory loss, head injury or confusion requires immediate medical attention. People with amnesia may not know where they are or be able to seek medical care. If someone you know has symptoms of amnesia, help the person get medical attention. Request an appointment"

People with Alzheimer's disease may: Repeat statements and questions over and over. Forget conversations, appointments or events. Misplace items, often putting them in places that don't make sense. Get lost in places they used to know well. Forget the names of family members and everyday objects. Have trouble finding the right words, expressing thoughts or having conversations. Thinking and reasoning Alzheimer's disease causes trouble concentrating and thinking, especially about abstract concepts such as numbers. Doing more than one task at once is especially hard. It may be challenging to manage finances, balance checkbooks and pay bills on time. Eventually people with Alzheimer's disease may not recognize numbers. Making judgments and decisions Alzheimer's disease makes it hard to make sensible decisions and judgments. People with Alzheimer's disease may make poor choices in social settings or wear clothes for the wrong type of weather. Everyday problems may be hard to solve. Someone with Alzheimer's disease may not know how to handle food burning on the stove or how to make decisions when driving. Planning and performing familiar tasks Routine activities that involve completing steps in a certain order also can be hard for people with Alzheimer's disease. They may have trouble planning and cooking a meal or playing a favorite game. As Alzheimer's disease becomes advanced, people forget how to do basic tasks such as dressing and bathing. Changes in personality and behavior Brain changes that occur in Alzheimer's disease can affect moods and behaviors. Symptoms may include: Depression. Loss of interest in activities. Social withdrawal. Mood swings. Not trusting others. Anger or aggression. Changes in sleeping habits. Wandering. Loss of inhibitions. Delusions, such as believing something has been stolen when it hasn't. Preserved skills Despite major changes to memory and skills, people with Alzheimer's disease are able to keep some skills even as symptoms get worse. These are known as preserved skills. They may include reading or listening to books, telling stories, sharing memories, singing, listening to music, dancing, drawing, or doing crafts. Preserved skills may last longer because they're managed by parts of the brain affected in later stages of the disease. When to see a doctor Several conditions can cause memory loss or other dementia symptoms. Some of those conditions can be treated. If you are concerned about your memory or other thinking skills, talk to your healthcare professional. If you are concerned about the thinking skills you notice in a family member or friend, ask about going together to talk to a healthcare professional.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),"Symptoms of ALS vary from person to person. Symptoms depend on which nerve cells are affected. ALS generally begins with muscle weakness that spreads and gets worse over time. Symptoms might include: Trouble walking or doing usual daily activities. Tripping and falling. Weakness in the legs, feet or ankles. Hand weakness or clumsiness. Slurred speech or trouble swallowing. Weakness associated with muscle cramps and twitching in the arms, shoulders and tongue. Untimely crying, laughing or yawning. Thinking or behavioral changes. ALS often starts in the hands, feet, arms or legs. Then it spreads to other parts of the body. Muscles get weaker as more nerve cells die. This eventually affects chewing, swallowing, speaking and breathing. There's generally no pain in the early stages of ALS . Pain also is not common in the later stages. ALS doesn't usually affect bladder control. It also usually doesn't affect the senses, including the ability to taste, smell, touch and hear.

Alpha-gal syndrome,"The symptoms of an alpha-gal allergic reaction usually take longer to start compared with those of other food allergies. Most reactions to common food allergens — peanuts or shellfish, for example — happen within minutes after you are exposed to them. In alpha-gal syndrome, reactions usually appear about 3 to 6 hours after you are exposed. Foods that can cause a reaction include: Red meat, such as beef, pork or lamb. Organ meats. Products made from mammals, such as gelatins or dairy products. Symptoms of alpha-gal syndrome may include: Hives, itching, or itchy, scaly skin. Swelling of the lips, face, tongue and throat, or other body parts. Wheezing or shortness of breath. Stomach pain, diarrhea, upset stomach or vomiting. The time delay between eating meat products and getting an allergic reaction may be one reason alpha-gal syndrome was not understood at first. For example, a possible connection between a T-bone steak with dinner and hives at midnight is far from clear. Researchers think they know the reason for the delayed reaction. They say it's due to the alpha-gal molecules taking longer than other allergens to be digested and enter the system that moves blood through the body. When to see a doctor Get help if you have food allergy symptoms after you eat, even several hours after you eat. See your primary care health care provider or an allergy specialist, called an allergist. Don't rule out red meat as a possible cause of your reaction. That's even more important if you live or spend time in parts of the world where alpha-gal syndrome has been reported. Get emergency medical treatment if you have symptoms of a serious allergic reaction that causes trouble breathing, called anaphylaxis, such as: Trouble breathing. Rapid, weak pulse. Dizzy or lightheaded feeling. Drooling and not being able to swallow. Full-body redness and warmth, called flushing.

Hair loss,"Male-pattern baldness Enlarge image Close Male-pattern baldness Male-pattern baldness Male-pattern baldness typically appears first at the hairline or top of the head. It can progress to partial or complete baldness. Female-pattern baldness Enlarge image Close Female-pattern baldness Female-pattern baldness Female-pattern baldness typically starts with scalp hairs becoming progressively less dense. Many women first experience hair thinning and hair loss where they part their hair and on the top-central portion of the head. Patchy hair loss (alopecia areata) Enlarge image Close Patchy hair loss (alopecia areata) Patchy hair loss (alopecia areata) In the type of patchy hair loss known as alopecia areata, hair loss occurs suddenly and usually starts with one or more circular bald patches that may overlap. Traction alopecia Enlarge image Close Traction alopecia Traction alopecia Hair loss can occur if you wear pigtails, braids or cornrows, or use tight hair rollers. This is called traction alopecia. Frontal fibrosing alopecia Enlarge image Close Frontal fibrosing alopecia Frontal fibrosing alopecia Early treatment of a receding hairline (frontal fibrosing alopecia) might help avoid significant permanent baldness. The cause of this condition is unknown, but it primarily affects older women. Hair loss can appear in many different ways, depending on what's causing it. It can come on suddenly or gradually and affect just your scalp or your whole body. Signs and symptoms of hair loss may include: Gradual thinning on top of head. This is the most common type of hair loss, affecting people as they age. In men, hair often begins to recede at the hairline on the forehead. Women typically have a broadening of the part in their hair. An increasingly common hair loss pattern in older women is a receding hairline (frontal fibrosing alopecia). Circular or patchy bald spots. Some people lose hair in circular or patchy bald spots on the scalp, beard or eyebrows. Your skin may become itchy or painful before the hair falls out. Sudden loosening of hair. A physical or emotional shock can cause hair to loosen. Handfuls of hair may come out when combing or washing your hair or even after gentle tugging. This type of hair loss usually causes overall hair thinning but is temporary. Full-body hair loss. Some conditions and medical treatments, such as chemotherapy for cancer, can result in the loss of hair all over your body. The hair usually grows back. Patches of scaling that spread over the scalp. This is a sign of ringworm. It may be accompanied by broken hair, redness, swelling and, at times, oozing. When to see a doctor See your doctor if you are distressed by persistent hair loss in you or your child and want to pursue treatment. For women who are experiencing a receding hairline (frontal fibrosing alopecia), talk with your doctor about early treatment to avoid significant permanent baldness. Also talk to your doctor if you notice sudden or patchy hair loss or more than usual hair loss when combing or washing your or your child's hair. Sudden hair loss can signal an underlying medical condition that requires treatment. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Allergies,"Allergy symptoms depend on what allergen is involved. The symptoms can affect the airways, sinuses and nasal passages, skin, and digestive system. Allergic reactions can range from mild to severe. Sometimes, allergies can trigger a life-threatening reaction known as anaphylaxis. Hay fever, also called allergic rhinitis, can cause: Sneezing. Itching of the skin, nose, eyes or roof of the mouth. Runny, stuffy nose. Tiredness, also called fatigue. Watery, red or swollen eyes, also called allergic conjunctivitis. A food allergy can cause: Tingling in the mouth. Swelling of the lips, tongue, face or throat. Itchy welts called hives. Stuffy nose, sneezing or teary eyes that itch. Stomach cramps, vomiting or diarrhea. Anaphylaxis. An insect sting allergy can cause: Pain and a large area of swelling called edema at the sting site. Itching or hives all over the body. Skin warmth and a change in skin color, also called flushing. Cough, chest tightness, wheezing or shortness of breath. Anaphylaxis. A medicine allergy can cause: Hives. Itchy skin or rash. Facial swelling. Wheezing. Shortness of breath. Vomiting or diarrhea. Feeling dizzy. Anaphylaxis. Atopic dermatitis, an allergic skin condition also called eczema, can cause skin to: Itch.

A drop in blood pressure. Severe shortness of breath and throat tightness. Skin rash with hives or welts. Dizziness. A rapid, weak pulse. Upset stomach, vomiting or diarrhea. A sense of doom. When to see a doctor You might see a healthcare professional if you have symptoms that you think are caused by an allergy, and over-the-counter allergy medicines sold without a prescription didn't give you enough relief. If you have symptoms after starting a new medicine for a health condition, call the healthcare professional who prescribed it right away. For a severe allergic reaction, also called anaphylaxis, call 911 or your local emergency number. Or get emergency medical help. A shot of prescription medicine called epinephrine is needed to treat anaphylaxis. If you carry an epinephrine auto-injector (Auvi-Q, EpiPen, others), give yourself a shot right away. Even if your symptoms get better after an epinephrine shot, go to the emergency room. Healthcare professionals need to make sure your symptoms don't come back when the effects of the shot wear off. If you've had a severe allergy attack or any symptoms of anaphylaxis in the past, make an appointment to see your healthcare professional. Allergy testing and the creation of a long-term treatment plan to manage anaphylaxis can be a challenge. So you'll likely need to see a doctor called an allergist who finds and treats allergies and other immune system conditions. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Churg-Strauss syndrome,
Alcoholic hepatitis,"The most common sign of alcoholic hepatitis is yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, called jaundice. The yellowing of the skin might be harder to see on Black and brown people. Other symptoms include: Loss of appetite. Nausea and vomiting. Belly tenderness. Fever, often low grade. Tiredness and weakness. People with alcoholic hepatitis tend to be malnourished. Drinking large amounts of alcohol keeps people from being hungry. And heavy drinkers get most of their calories from alcohol. Other symptoms that happen with severe alcoholic hepatitis include: Fluid buildup in the belly, called ascites. Being confused and acting oddly due to a buildup of toxins. The healthy liver breaks these toxins down and gets rid of them. Kidney and liver failure. When to see a doctor Alcoholic hepatitis is a serious, often deadly disease. See a healthcare professional if you: Have symptoms of alcoholic hepatitis. Can't control your drinking. Want help cutting back on your drinking. Request an appointment"
Alcohol poisoning,"Alcohol poisoning symptoms include: Confusion. Vomiting. Seizures. Slow breathing, which is fewer than eight breaths a minute. Breathing that's not regular. This is when there is a gap of more than 10 seconds between breaths. Skin that looks blue, gray or pale. Low body temperature, also known as hypothermia. Trouble staying conscious or awake. When to see a doctor It's not necessary to have all the above symptoms before seeking medical help. A person with alcohol poisoning who has passed out or can't wake up could die. Alcohol poisoning is an emergency If you think that someone has alcohol poisoning, seek medical care right away. This is true even if you don't see the usual signs. Here's what to do: Call 911 or your local emergency number right away. Never assume the person will sleep off alcohol poisoning. Be prepared to give information. If you know the kind and amount of alcohol the person drank, and when, tell hospital or emergency staff. Don't leave an unconscious person alone. Because alcohol poisoning affects the way the gag reflex works, someone with alcohol poisoning may vomit and choke and not be able to breathe. While waiting for help, don't try to make the person vomit because that could cause choking. Help someone who is vomiting. Try to keep the person sitting up. If the person must lie down, turn the head to the side to help prevent choking. Try to keep the person awake. Don't be afraid to get help It can be hard to decide if you think someone is drunk enough to need medical help. But it's best to take action right away rather than be sorry later. You may worry about what will happen to you or a friend or family member, especially if underage. But the results of not getting help in time can be far more serious.

Alcohol intolerance,
Albinism,"Symptoms of albinism involve skin, hair and eye color, as well as vision. Skin The easiest form of albinism to see results in white hair and very light-colored skin compared with siblings or other blood relatives. But skin coloring, also called pigmentation, and hair color can range from white to brown.

Moles, with or without color, which are sometimes pink. Large freckle-like spots, called solar lentigines (len-TIJ-ih-neez). Sunburn and no ability to tan. For some people with albinism, skin coloring never changes. For others, melanin production may begin or increase during childhood and the teen years, resulting in slight changes in color. Hair Hair color can range from very white to brown. People of African or Asian descent who have albinism may have hair color that's yellow, red or brown. Hair color also may darken by early adulthood. Or hair may stain from contact with minerals in water and the environment, making hair appear darker with age. Eye color Eyelashes and eyebrows are often pale. Eye color can range from very light blue to brown and may change with age. With albinism, the colored parts of the eyes, called the irises, usually don't have enough pigment. This allows light to shine through the irises and makes the eyes extremely sensitive to bright light. Because of this, very light-colored eyes may appear red in some lighting. Vision Vision problems are a key feature of all types of albinism. Eye problems may include: Rapid, back-and-forth movement of the eyes that can't be controlled, called nystagmus. An uncommon head position or head posture, such as tilting the head to try to reduce eye movements and see better. Eyes that can't look at the same direction at the same time or they appear to be crossed, a condition called strabismus. Problems seeing near objects or far objects, called farsightedness or nearsightedness. Extreme sensitivity to light, called photophobia. A difference in the curve of the front surface of the eye or the lens inside the eye, called astigmatism, which causes blurred vision. Differences in the development of the thin layer of tissue on the inside back wall of the eye, called the retina. This difference results in reduced vision. Nerve signals from the retina to the brain that don't follow the usual nerve pathways in the eye. This is called misrouting of the optic nerve. Poor depth perception, which means not being able to see things in three dimensions and judge how far away an object is. Legal blindness — vision less than 20/200 — or complete blindness. When to see a doctor At your child's birth, the health care provider may notice a lack of color in hair or skin that affects the eyelashes and eyebrows. The provider will likely order an eye exam and closely follow any changes in your child's skin color and vision. If you observe signs of albinism in your baby, talk to your health care provider. Contact your health care provider if your child with albinism experiences frequent nosebleeds, easy bruising or long-term infections. These symptoms may suggest rare but serious hereditary conditions that include albinism. Request an appointment"

Agoraphobia,"Typical agoraphobia symptoms include fear of: Leaving home alone. Crowds or waiting in line. Enclosed spaces, such as movie theaters, elevators or small stores. Open spaces, such as parking lots, bridges or malls. Using public transportation, such as a bus, plane or train. These situations cause anxiety because you fear you won't be able to escape or find help if you start to feel panicked. Or you may fear having other disabling or embarrassing symptoms, such as dizziness, fainting, falling or diarrhea. In addition: Your fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger of the situation.

Panic disorder and agoraphobia Some people have panic disorder in addition to agoraphobia. Panic disorder is a type of anxiety disorder that includes panic attacks. A panic attack is a sudden feeling of extreme fear that reaches a peak within a few minutes and triggers a variety of intense physical symptoms. You might think that you're totally losing control, having a heart attack or even dying. Fear of another panic attack can lead to avoiding similar situations or the place where it happened in an attempt to prevent future panic attacks. Symptoms of a panic attack can include: Rapid heart rate. Trouble breathing or a feeling of choking. Chest pain or pressure. Lightheadedness or dizziness. Feeling shaky, numb or tingling. Sweating too much. Sudden flushing or chills. Upset stomach or diarrhea. Feeling a loss of control. Fear of dying.

Wet macular degeneration,"Wet macular degeneration symptoms usually appear suddenly and worsen quickly. They may include: Visual distortions, such as straight lines that seem to be bent. Reduced central vision in one or both eyes. The need for brighter light when reading or doing close-up work. Difficulty adjusting to low light levels, such as when entering a dimly lit restaurant or theater. Increased blurriness of printed words. Difficulty recognizing faces. A well-defined blurry spot or blind spot in the field of vision. Macular degeneration doesn't affect side vision, so it doesn't cause total blindness. When to see a doctor See your eye care professional if: You notice changes in your central vision. You lose the ability to see fine detail. These changes may be the first sign of macular degeneration, particularly if you're older than age 60.

Dry macular degeneration,"Dry macular degeneration symptoms usually develop gradually and without pain. They may include: Visual distortions, such as straight lines seeming bent. Reduced central vision in one or both eyes. The need for brighter light when reading or doing close-up work. Increased difficulty adapting to low light levels, such as when entering a dimly lit restaurant or theater. Increased blurriness of printed words. Difficulty recognizing faces. A well-defined blurry spot or blind spot in the field of vision. Dry macular degeneration can affect one or both eyes. If only one eye is affected, you may not notice any changes in your vision. This is because your good eye may compensate for the affected eye. And the condition doesn't affect the side vision, so it does not cause total blindness. Dry macular degeneration is one of two types of age-related macular degeneration. It can progress to wet macular degeneration, which is when blood vessels grow and leak under the retina. The dry type is more common, but it usually progresses slowly over years. The wet type is more likely to cause a relatively sudden change in vision resulting in serious vision loss. When to see a doctor See your eye care professional if: You notice changes, such as distortion or blind spots, in your central vision. You lose the ability to see fine detail. These changes may be the first sign of macular degeneration, particularly if you're over age 60. Request an appointment"

Benign adrenal tumors,"Symptoms depend on whether the tumor makes hormones, what hormone it makes and how much it makes. But many benign adrenal gland tumors don't cause symptoms because they don't make hormones. The most common type of benign adrenal tumor, called adenoma, comes from the adrenal cortex. This type of tumor might cause symptoms such as: Weight gain. Easy bruising. High blood pressure, also called hypertension. Diabetes. Depressed mood. Tiredness. Muscle weakness or cramping. A type of benign adrenal tumor from the medulla is called pheochromocytoma. It might cause the following symptoms: High blood pressure, also called hypertension. Fast heartbeat. Sweating. Tremors. Headache."
Adrenal cancer,"Signs and symptoms of adrenal cancer may include: Back pain. Belly pain. Losing weight without trying. Loss of appetite. Many people who have adrenal cancer develop hormone changes in the body. These changes can happen if the cancer cells make extra hormones. Most often, the adrenal cancer makes the hormone cortisol. This can cause symptoms of Cushing syndrome, including: Weight gain. Muscle weakness. Pink or purple stretch marks on the skin. Bruises that happen even with a small injury. High blood pressure. High blood sugar or diabetes. Less often, an adrenal cancer might make the sex hormones estrogen and testosterone. In females, changes in the sex hormones can cause extra facial hair, hair loss on the head and periods that aren't regular. In males, these hormone changes may cause the testicles to shrink and breast tissue to get bigger. Rarely, adrenal cancer may make the hormone aldosterone. That can cause high blood pressure and low levels of potassium in the blood. When to see a doctor Make an appointment with a healthcare professional if you have any symptoms that worry you."
Childhood schizophrenia,"Schizophrenia involves a range of problems with thinking, behavior or emotions. Signs and symptoms may vary, but usually involve delusions, hallucinations or disorganized speech, and reflect an impaired ability to function. The effect can be disabling. In most people with schizophrenia, symptoms generally start in the mid- to late 20s, though it can start later, up to the mid-30s. Schizophrenia is considered early onset when it starts before the age of 18. Onset of schizophrenia in children younger than age 13 is extremely rare. Symptoms can vary in type and severity over time, with periods of worsening and remission of symptoms. Some symptoms may always be present. Schizophrenia can be difficult to recognize in the early phases. Early signs and symptoms Schizophrenia signs and symptoms in children and teenagers are similar to those in adults, but the condition may be more difficult to recognize in this age group. Early signs and symptoms may include problems with thinking, behavior and emotions. Thinking: Problems with thinking and reasoning Bizarre ideas or speech Confusing dreams or television for reality Behavior: Withdrawal from friends and family Trouble sleeping Lack of motivation — for example, showing up as a drop in performance at school Not meeting daily expectations, such as bathing or dressing Bizarre behavior Violent or aggressive behavior or agitation Recreational drug or nicotine use Emotions: Irritability or depressed mood Lack of emotion, or emotions inappropriate for the situation Strange anxieties and fears Excessive suspicion of others Later signs and symptoms As children with schizophrenia age, more typical signs and symptoms of the disorder begin to appear. Signs and symptoms may include: Delusions. These are false beliefs that are not based in reality. For example, you think that you're being harmed or harassed; that certain gestures or comments are directed at you; that you have exceptional ability or fame; that another person is in love with you; or that a major catastrophe is about to occur. Delusions occur in most people with schizophrenia. Hallucinations. These usually involve seeing or hearing things that don't exist. Yet for the person with schizophrenia, hallucinations have the full force and impact of a normal experience. Hallucinations can be in any of the senses, but hearing voices is the most common hallucination. Disorganized thinking. Disorganized thinking is inferred from disorganized speech. Effective communication can be impaired, and answers to questions may be partially or completely unrelated. Rarely, speech may include putting together meaningless words that can't be understood, sometimes known as word salad. Extremely disorganized or abnormal motor behavior. This may show in several ways, from childlike silliness to unpredictable agitation. Behavior is not focused on a goal, which makes it hard to do tasks. Behavior can include resistance to instructions, inappropriate or bizarre posture, a complete lack of response, or useless and excessive movement. Negative symptoms. This refers to reduced or lack of ability to function normally. For example, the person may neglect personal hygiene or appear to lack emotion — doesn't make eye contact, doesn't change facial expressions, speaks in a monotone, or doesn't add hand or head movements that normally occur when speaking. Also, the person may avoid people and activities or lack the ability to experience pleasure. Compared with schizophrenia symptoms in adults, children and teens may be: Less likely to have delusions More likely to have visual hallucinations Symptoms may be difficult to interpret When childhood schizophrenia begins early in life, symptoms may build up gradually. Early signs and symptoms may be so vague that you can't recognize what's wrong. Some early signs can be mistaken for typical development during early teen years, or they could be symptoms of other mental or physical conditions. As time goes on, signs may become more severe and more noticeable. Eventually, your child may develop the symptoms of psychosis, including hallucinations, delusions and difficulty organizing thoughts. As thoughts become more disorganized, there's often a ""break from reality"" (psychosis) frequently requiring hospitalization and treatment with medication. When to see a doctor It can be difficult to know how to handle vague behavioral changes in your child. You may be afraid of rushing to conclusions that label your child with a mental illness. Your child's teacher or other school staff may alert you to changes in your child's behavior. Seek medical care as soon as possible if you have concerns about your child's behavior or development. Suicidal thoughts and behavior Suicidal thoughts and behavior are common among people with schizophrenia. If you have a child or teen who is in danger of attempting suicide or has made a suicide attempt, make sure someone stays with him or her. Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Or if you think you can do so safely, take your child to the nearest hospital emergency room. Request an appointment"

Adjustment disorders,"Symptoms depend on the type of adjustment disorder. These symptoms can vary from person to person. You experience more stress than would generally be expected in response to a trying event, and this stress causes a lot of problems in your life. Adjustment disorders affect how you feel and think about yourself and the world. They also may affect your actions or behavior. Some examples include: Feeling sad, hopeless or not enjoying things you used to enjoy. Crying often. Worrying, or feeling anxious, nervous, jittery or stressed out. Feeling irritable or like you can't handle anything and don't know where to start. Having trouble sleeping. Not eating enough. Having difficulty concentrating. Having difficulty with daily activities. Withdrawing from family and friends who support you socially. Not doing important things, such as going to work or paying bills. Thinking about suicide or acting on those thoughts. Symptoms of an adjustment disorder start within three months of a stressful event. These symptoms last no longer than six months after the end of the stressful event. But constant or lasting adjustment disorders can continue for more than six months. This is especially true if the stressful event is ongoing, such as being unemployed. When to see a doctor Stressors are usually temporary. You learn to cope with them over time. Symptoms of adjustment disorder usually get better when the stress eases. But sometimes the stressful event continues to be a part of your life. Or a new stressful situation comes up, and you face the same emotional struggles all over again. Talk to your doctor or a mental health professional if you continue to struggle or if you're having trouble getting through each day. You can get treatment to help you cope better with stressful events and feel better about life again. If you have concerns about your child's behavior, talk with your child's doctor. Suicidal thoughts or behavior The risk of suicide can be higher in people who have adjustment disorders. If you're thinking about suicide, contact a hotline for counseling: In the U.S., call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline . It's available 24 hours a day, every day. Or use the Lifeline Chat . Services are free and private. U.S. veterans or service members who are in crisis can call 988 and then press ""1"" for the Veterans Crisis Line . Or text 838255.

Adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),"Some people with ADHD have fewer symptoms as they age, but some adults continue to have major symptoms that interfere with daily functioning. In adults, the main features of ADHD may include difficulty paying attention, impulsiveness and restlessness. Symptoms can range from mild to severe. Many adults with ADHD aren't aware they have it — they just know that everyday tasks can be a challenge. Adults with ADHD may find it difficult to focus and prioritize, leading to missed deadlines and forgotten meetings or social plans. The inability to control impulses can range from impatience waiting in line or driving in traffic to mood swings and outbursts of anger. Adult ADHD symptoms may include: Impulsiveness Disorganization and problems prioritizing Poor time management skills Problems focusing on a task Trouble multitasking Excessive activity or restlessness Poor planning Low frustration tolerance Frequent mood swings Problems following through and completing tasks Hot temper Trouble coping with stress What's typical behavior and what's ADHD? Almost everyone has some symptoms similar to ADHD at some point in their lives. If your difficulties are recent or occurred only occasionally in the past, you probably don't have ADHD . ADHD is diagnosed only when symptoms are severe enough to cause ongoing problems in more than one area of your life. These persistent and disruptive symptoms can be traced back to early childhood. Diagnosis of ADHD in adults can be difficult because certain ADHD symptoms are similar to those caused by other conditions, such as anxiety or mood disorders. And many adults with ADHD also have at least one other mental health condition, such as depression or anxiety. When to see a doctor If any of the symptoms listed above continually disrupt your life, talk to your doctor about whether you might have ADHD . Different types of health care professionals may diagnose and supervise treatment for ADHD . Seek a provider who has training and experience in caring for adults with ADHD .

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children,"The main features of ADHD include not paying attention and being hyperactive and impulsive. ADHD symptoms usually start before age 12. In some children, they can be seen as early as 3 years of age. ADHD symptoms can be mild, moderate or severe. Symptoms need to be seen in two or more settings, such as at home and at school. The symptoms cause problems with development and daily life and may continue into adulthood. ADHD occurs more often in boys than in girls. Behaviors can be different in boys and girls. For example, boys may be more hyperactive and girls may tend to quietly not pay attention. There are three types of ADHD: Predominately inattentive. In this type, most symptoms fall under inattention. This means having trouble focusing and staying on a task. It also includes trouble getting and staying organized. Predominately hyperactive and impulsive. In this type, most symptoms involve being hyperactive and impulsive. Hyperactive means being too active and having too much energy. It may include disruptive behavior. Being impulsive means acting without thinking ahead about the results or effects of behavior. Combined. This type is a mix of inattentive symptoms and hyperactive and impulsive symptoms. The person meets the criteria for both predominately inattentive and predominately hyperactive and impulsive types of ADHD. Inattentive symptoms A child who shows a pattern of inattention may often: Fail to pay close attention to details or make careless mistakes in schoolwork. Have trouble staying focused in tasks or play. Seem not to listen, even when spoken to directly. Have a hard time following through on instructions and not finish schoolwork or chores. Have trouble organizing tasks and activities. Stay away from or not like tasks that need focused mental effort, such as homework. Lose items needed for tasks or activities, for example, toys, school assignments, pencils. Be easily distracted by other things, thoughts or activities rather than finishing a task. Forget to do some daily activities, such as forgetting to do chores. Hyperactive and impulsive symptoms A child who shows a pattern of hyperactive and impulsive symptoms may often: Fidget with or tap hands or feet, or squirm in the seat. Have a hard time staying seated in the classroom or in other situations. Be on the go, in constant motion. Run around or climb in situations when it's not proper. Have trouble playing or doing an activity quietly. Talk too much. Blurt out answers, interrupting the questioner. Have trouble waiting for a turn. Interrupt others' conversations, games or activities. Typical development versus ADHD Most healthy children are inattentive, hyperactive or impulsive at one time or another. It's typical for preschoolers to have short attention spans and not be able to stick with one activity for long. Even in older children and teenagers, attention span often depends on the level of interest. The same is true of hyperactivity. Young children are naturally energetic. They often are still full of energy long after they've tired their parents. And some children just naturally have a higher activity level than others do. Children should never be classified as having ADHD just because they're different from their friends or siblings. Children who have problems in school but get along well at home or with friends may likely have a concern other than ADHD. The same is true of children who are hyperactive or inattentive at home but whose schoolwork and friendships aren't affected. When to see a doctor If you're concerned that your child shows signs of ADHD, see your pediatrician or family healthcare professional. Your healthcare professional can do a medical evaluation to check for other causes of your child's symptoms. Then if needed, your child may be referred to a specialist, such as a developmental-behavioral pediatrician, psychologist, psychiatrist or pediatric neurologist.

Nicotine dependence,"For some people, using any amount of tobacco can quickly lead to nicotine dependence. Signs that you may be addicted include: You can't stop smoking. You've made one or more serious, but unsuccessful, attempts to stop. You have withdrawal symptoms when you try to stop. Your attempts at stopping have caused physical and mood-related symptoms, such as strong cravings, anxiety, irritability, restlessness, difficulty concentrating, depressed mood, frustration, anger, increased hunger, insomnia, constipation or diarrhea. You keep smoking despite health problems. Even though you've developed health problems with your lungs or your heart, you haven't been able to stop. You give up social activities. You may stop going to smoke-free restaurants or stop socializing with family or friends because you can't smoke in these situations. When to see a doctor You're not alone if you've tried to stop smoking but haven't been able to stop for good. Most smokers make many attempts to stop smoking before they achieve stable, long-term abstinence from smoking. You're more likely to stop for good if you follow a treatment plan that addresses both the physical and the behavioral aspects of nicotine dependence. Using medications and working with a counselor specially trained to help people stop smoking (a tobacco treatment specialist) will significantly boost your chances of success. Ask your health care team to help you develop a treatment plan that works for you or to advise you on where to get help to stop smoking. Request an appointment"

Many people have a headache, fever and other symptoms of an infection followed by: Psychiatric symptoms that may include anxiety, panic attacks, changes in behavior, agitation, hallucinations, delusions and trouble organizing thoughts. Trouble with memory. Trouble with language, such as talking less or repeating words or phrases. Movements that are not voluntary. Seizures. Changes in consciousness. Less sleep at the beginning of the disease followed by excess sleep during recovery. Sometimes AE causes serious seizures that need emergency care, known as status epilepticus. These seizures last more than five minutes or occur one after another while the person is not conscious. Autoimmune encephalitis symptoms can get worse over time. This disease course is known as progressive. Symptoms also might alternate between getting better and getting worse. This course is known as relapsing-remitting. These are similar to the disease courses people experience with multiple sclerosis. When to see a doctor Get emergency medical care if you or someone you're with has serious symptoms of AE. This includes having seizures that last more than five minutes or that happen one after another with a loss of consciousness. Also seek emergency medical care for high fevers or trouble breathing. See your healthcare professional right away if you have any other symptoms of autoimmune encephalitis. AE can become serious quickly if not treated. Request an appointment"
Alcohol use disorder,"Alcohol use disorder can be mild, moderate or severe, based on the number of symptoms you experience. Signs and symptoms may include: Being unable to limit the amount of alcohol you drink Wanting to cut down on how much you drink or making unsuccessful attempts to do so Spending a lot of time drinking, getting alcohol or recovering from alcohol use Feeling a strong craving or urge to drink alcohol Failing to fulfill major obligations at work, school or home due to repeated alcohol use Continuing to drink alcohol even though you know it's causing physical, social, work or relationship problems Giving up or reducing social and work activities and hobbies to use alcohol Using alcohol in situations where it's not safe, such as when driving or swimming Developing a tolerance to alcohol so you need more to feel its effect or you have a reduced effect from the same amount Experiencing withdrawal symptoms — such as nausea, sweating and shaking — when you don't drink, or drinking to avoid these symptoms Alcohol use disorder can include periods of being drunk (alcohol intoxication) and symptoms of withdrawal. Alcohol intoxication results as the amount of alcohol in your bloodstream increases. The higher the blood alcohol concentration is, the more likely you are to have bad effects. Alcohol intoxication causes behavior problems and mental changes. These may include inappropriate behavior, unstable moods, poor judgment, slurred speech, problems with attention or memory, and poor coordination. You can also have periods called ""blackouts,"" where you don't remember events. Very high blood alcohol levels can lead to coma, permanent brain damage or even death. Alcohol withdrawal can occur when alcohol use has been heavy and prolonged and is then stopped or greatly reduced. It can occur within several hours to 4 to 5 days later. Signs and symptoms include sweating, rapid heartbeat, hand tremors, problems sleeping, nausea and vomiting, hallucinations, restlessness and agitation, anxiety, and occasionally seizures. Symptoms can be severe enough to impair your ability to function at work or in social situations. What is considered 1 drink? The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines one standard drink as any one of these: 12 ounces (355 milliliters) of regular beer (about 5% alcohol) 8 to 9 ounces (237 to 266 milliliters) of malt liquor (about 7% alcohol) 5 ounces (148 milliliters) of wine (about 12% alcohol) 1.5 ounces (44 milliliters) of hard liquor or distilled spirits (about 40% alcohol) When to see a doctor If you feel that you sometimes drink too much alcohol, or your drinking is causing problems, or if your family is concerned about your drinking, talk with your health care provider. Other ways to get help include talking with a mental health professional or seeking help from a support group such as Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar type of self-help group. Because denial is common, you may feel like you don't have a problem with drinking. You might not recognize how much you drink or how many problems in your life are related to alcohol use. Listen to relatives, friends or co-workers when they ask you to examine your drinking habits or to seek help. Consider talking with someone who has had a problem with drinking but has stopped. If your loved one needs help Many people with alcohol use disorder hesitate to get treatment because they don't recognize that they have a problem. An intervention from loved ones can help some people recognize and accept that they need professional help. If you're concerned about someone who drinks too much, ask a professional experienced in alcohol treatment for advice on how to approach that person. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Radiation sickness,"The severity of radiation sickness symptoms depends on how much radiation you've absorbed. How much you absorb depends on the strength of the radiated energy, the time of your exposures, and the distance between you and the source of radiation.

For instance, the gastrointestinal system and bone marrow are highly sensitive to radiation. Initial symptoms The first symptoms of treatable radiation sickness are usually nausea and vomiting. The amount of time between exposure and when these symptoms develop is a clue to how much radiation a person has absorbed. After the first round of symptoms, a person with radiation sickness may have a brief period with no noticeable illness, followed by the onset of new, more-serious symptoms.

HIV/AIDS,"The symptoms of HIV and AIDS vary depending on the person and the phase of infection. Primary infection, also called acute HIV Some people infected by HIV get a flu-like illness within 2 to 4 weeks after the virus enters the body. This stage may last a few days to several weeks. Some people have no symptoms during this stage. Possible symptoms include: Fever. Headache. Muscle aches and joint pain. Rash. Sore throat and painful mouth sores. Swollen lymph glands, also called nodes, mainly on the neck. Diarrhea. Weight loss. Cough. Night sweats. These symptoms can be so mild that you might not notice them. However, the amount of virus in your bloodstream, called viral load, is high at this time. As a result, the infection spreads to others more easily during primary infection than during the next stage. Clinical latent infection, also called chronic HIV In this stage of infection, HIV is still in the body and cells of the immune system, called white blood cells. But during this time, many people don't have symptoms or the infections that HIV can cause. This stage can last for many years for people who aren't getting antiretroviral therapy, also called ART. Some people get more-severe disease much sooner. Symptomatic HIV infection As the virus continues to multiply and destroy immune cells, you may get mild infections or long-term symptoms such as: Fever. Fatigue. Swollen lymph glands, which are often one of the first symptoms of HIV infection. Diarrhea. Weight loss. Oral yeast infection, also called thrush. Shingles, also called herpes zoster. Pneumonia. Progression to AIDS Better antiviral treatments have greatly decreased deaths from AIDS worldwide. Thanks to these lifesaving treatments, most people with HIV in the U.S. today don't get AIDS . Untreated, HIV most often turns into AIDS in about 8 to 10 years. Having AIDS means your immune system is very damaged. People with AIDS are more likely to develop diseases they wouldn't get if they had healthy immune systems. These are called opportunistic infections or opportunistic cancers. Some people get opportunistic infections during the acute stage of the disease. The symptoms of some of these infections may include: Sweats. Chills. Fever that keeps coming back. Ongoing diarrhea. Swollen lymph glands. Constant white spots or lesions on the tongue or in the mouth. Constant fatigue. Weakness. Rapid weight loss. Skin rashes or bumps. When to see a doctor If you think you may have been infected with HIV or are at risk of contracting the virus, see a healthcare professional as soon as you can.

Acoustic neuroma,"Symptoms of an acoustic neuroma are often easy to miss and may take years to develop. Symptoms may occur because of the tumor's effects on the hearing and balance nerves. The tumor also can put pressure on nearby nerves controlling facial muscles, known as the facial nerve, and sensation, known as the trigeminal nerve. Blood vessels or brain structures also can be affected by an acoustic neuroma. As the tumor grows, it may be more likely to cause more noticeable or worse symptoms. Common symptoms of an acoustic neuroma include: Hearing loss, usually gradually over months to years. In rare cases, hearing loss can be sudden. Hearing loss usually occurs on one side or is worse on one side. Ringing in the affected ear, known as tinnitus. Loss of balance or not feeling steady. Dizziness.

Acne,"Cystic acne Enlarge image Close Cystic acne Cystic acne Cystic acne — the most severe form of acne — occurs when oil and dead skin cells build up deep within hair follicles. The resulting rupture within your skin may form boil-like inflammation. Acne signs vary depending on the severity of your condition: Whiteheads (closed plugged pores) Blackheads (open plugged pores) Small red, tender bumps (papules) Pimples (pustules), which are papules with pus at their tips Large, solid, painful lumps under the skin (nodules) Painful, pus-filled lumps under the skin (cystic lesions) Acne usually appears on the face, forehead, chest, upper back and shoulders. When to see a doctor If self-care remedies don't clear your acne, see your primary care doctor. He or she can prescribe stronger medications. If acne persists or is severe, you may want to seek medical treatment from a doctor who specializes in the skin (dermatologist or pediatric dermatologist). For many women, acne can persist for decades, with flares common a week before menstruation. This type of acne tends to clear up without treatment in women who use contraceptives. In older adults, a sudden onset of severe acne may signal an underlying disease requiring medical attention. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that some popular nonprescription acne lotions, cleansers and other skin products can cause a serious reaction. This type of reaction is quite rare, so don't confuse it with any redness, irritation or itchiness that occurs in areas where you've applied medications or products. Seek emergency medical help if after using a skin product you experience: Faintness Difficulty breathing Swelling of the eyes, face, lips or tongue Tightness of the throat Request an appointment There is a problem with

Tinnitus,"Tinnitus is most often described as a ringing in the ears, even though no external sound is present. However, tinnitus can also cause other types of phantom noises in your ears, including: Buzzing Roaring Clicking Hissing Humming Most people who have tinnitus have subjective tinnitus, or tinnitus that only you can hear. The noises of tinnitus may vary in pitch from a low roar to a high squeal, and you may hear it in one or both ears. In some cases, the sound can be so loud it interferes with your ability to concentrate or hear external sound. Tinnitus may be present all the time, or it may come and go. In rare cases, tinnitus can occur as a rhythmic pulsing or whooshing sound, often in time with your heartbeat. This is called pulsatile tinnitus. If you have pulsatile tinnitus, your doctor may be able to hear your tinnitus when he or she does an examination (objective tinnitus). When to see a doctor Some people aren't very bothered by tinnitus. For other people, tinnitus disrupts their daily lives. If you have tinnitus that bothers you, see your doctor. Make an appointment to see your doctor if: You develop tinnitus after an upper respiratory infection, such as a cold, and your tinnitus doesn't improve within a week. See your doctor as soon as possible if: You have hearing loss or dizziness with the tinnitus. You are experiencing anxiety or depression as a result of your tinnitus. Mayo Clinic Minute: Is tinnitus causing that ringing in your ear? Show transcript for video Mayo Clinic Minute: Is tinnitus causing that ringing in your ear? About 1 in 5 people experience the perception of noise or ringing in the ears. It's called tinnitus. Dr. Gayla Poling says tinnitus can be perceived a myriad of ways. ""Ninety percent of those with tinnitus have hearing loss."" Hearing loss can be age-related, come from a one-time exposure, or exposure to loud sounds over a lifetime. Dr. Poling says the tiny hairs in our inner ear may play a role. ""Those little hair cells in our inner ear are really delicate structures. That's what is actually damaged with noise exposure."" Dr. Poling says there's no scientifically proven cure for tinnitus, but there are treatment and management options. ""Something as simple as getting a hearing aid to really treat the hearing loss."" Other options include using a sound generator or using a fan at night. ""There's something called 'tinnitus retraining therapy.'"" There are more ear-level masking devices where you can hear sounds throughout the day, too, that are more distracting."" If ringing in your ears bothers you, start by seeing your health care provider for a hearing test. For the Mayo Clinic News Network, I'm Ian Roth. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Vocal cord paralysis,"Vocal cords open and closed Enlarge image Close Vocal cords open and closed Vocal cords open and closed Vocal cords open when you breathe and then close to produce sound when vibrating together. Vocal cord paralysis usually involves the loss of control of only one vocal cord. Paralysis of both vocal cords is a rare but serious condition. This can make it hard to speak and can cause trouble with breathing and swallowing. The vocal cords are two flexible bands of muscle tissue that sit at the entrance to the windpipe, also known as the trachea. When speaking, the bands come together and vibrate to make sound. The rest of the time, the vocal cords are relaxed in an open position so that you can breathe. Symptoms of vocal cord paralysis may include: A breathy quality to the voice. Hoarseness. Noisy breathing. Shortness of breath. Loss of vocal pitch. Choking or coughing while swallowing food, drink or saliva. The need to take several breaths while speaking. Inability to speak loudly. Loss of a gag reflex. Ineffective coughing. Frequent throat clearing.

Small soft bumps under or around the nails may occur. Growths on the face that start in childhood and look like acne are common. Seizures. Growths in the brain may be linked with seizures. A seizure is often the first symptom of tuberous sclerosis. In small children, a common type of seizure called infantile spasm involves stiffening of the arms and legs and arching the back and head. Problems in thinking, reasoning and learning. Tuberous sclerosis can result in developmental delays. Sometimes it limits the ability to think, reason and learn. Mental health conditions, such as autism spectrum disorder or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), also can occur. Behavior problems. Common behavior problems may include hyperactivity, self-injury or aggression, or issues with social and emotional adjustment. Kidney problems. Growths on the kidneys are common, and more growths may develop with age. Heart issues. Growths in the heart, if present, are usually largest at birth and shrink as a child gets older. Lung problems. Growths that develop in the lungs may cause coughing or trouble breathing, especially with physical activity or exercise. These lung tumors occur more often in females than in males. Eye problems. Growths can appear as white patches on the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye called the retina. These growths usually don't interfere with vision. Dental changes. Teeth may have pits in the surface. Small growths may appear on the gums, inside of the cheeks and on the tongue. When to see a doctor Symptoms of tuberous sclerosis may be noticed at birth. Or the first symptoms may appear during childhood or even years later in adulthood.

Trichinosis,
Transverse myelitis,
Transposition of the great arteries,"Transposition of the great arteries (TGA) may be seen in a baby before birth during a routine pregnancy ultrasound. But some people with the congenitally corrected type of TGA may not have symptoms for many years. Symptoms of transposition of the great arteries after birth include: Blue or gray skin. Depending on the baby's skin color, these color changes may be harder or easier to see. Weak pulse. Lack of appetite. Poor weight gain. Skin color changes may not be noticed right away if a baby with TGA also has other heart problems. This is because the other heart problems may let some oxygen-rich blood move through the body. But as the baby becomes more active, less blood flows through the body. The blue or gray skin color then becomes more noticeable. When to see a doctor Always seek emergency medical help if you notice that anyone develops a blue or gray skin color. Request an appointment"
Trachoma,"Signs and symptoms of trachoma usually affect both eyes and may include: Mild itching and irritation of the eyes and eyelids Eye discharge containing mucus or pus Eyelid swelling Light sensitivity (photophobia) Eye pain Eye redness Vision loss Young children are particularly susceptible to infection. But the disease progresses slowly, and the more painful symptoms may not emerge until adulthood. The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified five stages in the development of trachoma: Inflammation — follicular. The early infection has five or more follicles — small bumps that contain lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell — visible with magnification on the inner surface of your upper eyelid (conjunctiva). Inflammation — intense. In this stage, your eye is now highly infectious and becomes irritated, with a thickening or swelling of the upper eyelid. Eyelid scarring. Repeated infections lead to scarring of the inner eyelid. The scars often appear as white lines when examined with magnification. Your eyelid may become distorted and may turn in (entropion). In-turned eyelashes (trichiasis). The scarred inner lining of your eyelid continues to deform, causing your lashes to turn in so that they rub on and scratch the transparent outer surface of your eye (cornea). Corneal clouding (opacity). The cornea becomes affected by an inflammation that is most commonly seen under your upper lid. Continuous inflammation compounded by scratching from the in-turned lashes leads to clouding of the cornea. All the signs of trachoma are more severe in your upper lid than in your lower lid. Without intervention, a disease process that begins in childhood can continue to advance into adulthood. When to see a doctor Call your doctor if you or your child has itchy or irritated eyes or discharge from the eyes, especially if you live in or recently traveled to an area where trachoma is common. Trachoma is a contagious condition. Treating it as soon as possible helps prevent serious infection. Request an appointment"
Toxoplasmosis,"Most people infected with toxoplasmosis do not have any symptoms. They often don't know they're infected. Some people have flu-like symptoms, including: Fever. Swollen lymph nodes that may last for weeks. Headache. Muscle aches. Skin rash. Symptoms of eye disease The toxoplasma parasites may infect tissues of the inner eye. This can occur in people with healthy immune systems. But the disease is more serious in people with weakened immunity. An infection in the eye is called ocular toxoplasmosis. Symptoms may include: Eye pain. Poor vision. Floaters, which are specks that seem to swim in your vision. Untreated eye disease can cause blindness. Effect on people with weakened immune systems People with weakened immune systems are likely to have more-serious disease from toxoplasmosis. A toxoplasmosis infection from earlier in life may become active again. People at risk include those living with HIV/AIDS, people receiving cancer treatment and people with a transplanted organ. In addition to serious eye disease, toxoplasmosis can cause severe lung or brain disease for a person with weakened immunity. Rarely, the infection can show up in other tissues throughout the body. Lung infection may cause: Breathing problems. Fever. Cough. Toxoplasmosis may cause inflammation of the brain, also called encephalitis. Symptoms may include: Confusion. Poor coordination. Muscle weakness. Seizures. Changes in alertness. Effect on fetus or infant Toxoplasmosis can pass from the mother to the fetus during a pregnancy. This is called congenital toxoplasmosis. Infection during the first trimester often causes more-severe disease. It also may result in miscarriage. For some babies with toxoplasmosis, serious disease may be present at birth or appear early in infancy. Medical problems may include: Too much fluid in or around the brain, also called hydrocephalus. Severe eye infection. Irregularities in brain tissues. An enlarged liver or spleen. Symptoms of severe disease vary. They may include: Problems with mental or motor skills. Blindness or other vision problems. Hearing problems. Seizures. Heart disorders. Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, also called jaundice. Rash. Most babies with toxoplasmosis do not show symptoms. But problems may show up later in childhood or teenage years. These include: Return of eye infections. Problems with motor skill development. Problems with thinking and learning. Hearing loss. Slowed growth. Early puberty. When to see a doctor Talk to your health care provider about a test if you are worried about exposure to the parasite. If you are planning a pregnancy or are pregnant, see your provider if you suspect exposure. The symptoms of severe toxoplasmosis include blurred vision, confusion and loss of coordination. These need immediate medical care, particularly if you have a weakened immune system. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Toxic shock syndrome,
Tourette syndrome,"Tics — sudden, brief, intermittent movements or sounds — are the hallmark sign of Tourette syndrome. They can range from mild to severe. Severe symptoms might significantly interfere with communication, daily functioning and quality of life. Tics are classified as: Simple tics. These sudden, brief and repetitive tics involve a limited number of muscle groups. Complex tics. These distinct, coordinated patterns of movements involve several muscle groups. Tics can also involve movement (motor tics) or sounds (vocal tics). Motor tics usually begin before vocal tics do. But the spectrum of tics that people experience is diverse. Common motor tics seen in Tourette syndrome Simple tics Complex tics Eye blinking Touching or smelling objects Head jerking Repeating observed movements Shoulder shrugging Stepping in a certain pattern Eye darting Obscene gesturing Nose twitching Bending or twisting Mouth movements Hopping Common vocal tics seen in Tourette syndrome Simple tics Complex tics Grunting Repeating one's own words or phrases Coughing Repeating others' words or phrases Throat clearing Using vulgar, obscene or swear words Barking In addition, tics can: Vary in type, frequency and severity Worsen if you're ill, stressed, anxious, tired or excited Occur during sleep Change over time Worsen in the early teenage years and improve during the transition into adulthood Before the onset of motor or vocal tics, you'll likely experience an uncomfortable bodily sensation (premonitory urge) such as an itch, a tingle or tension. Expression of the tic brings relief. With great effort, some people with Tourette syndrome can temporarily stop or hold back a tic. When to see a doctor See your child's pediatrician if you notice your child displaying involuntary movements or sounds. Not all tics indicate Tourette syndrome. Many children develop tics that go away on their own after a few weeks or months. But whenever a child shows unusual behavior, it's important to identify the cause and rule out serious health problems. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Thoracic outlet syndrome,"There are three types of thoracic outlet syndrome: Neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome. This is the most common type of thoracic outlet syndrome. In this type, a group of nerves called the brachial plexus is compressed. The nerves of the brachial plexus come from the spinal cord. The nerves control muscle movements and feeling in the shoulder, arm and hand. Venous thoracic outlet syndrome. This type of thoracic outlet syndrome occurs when one or more of the veins under the collarbone are compressed and damaged. This can result in blood clots. Arterial thoracic outlet syndrome. This is the least common type of TOS. It occurs when one of the arteries under the collarbone is compressed. The compression may cause injury to the artery resulting in a bulge, known as an aneurysm, or blood clot formation. Thoracic outlet syndrome symptoms can vary depending on the type. When nerves are compressed, symptoms of neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome include: Numbness or tingling in the arm or fingers. Pain or aches in the neck, shoulder, arm or hand. Arm fatigue with activity. A weakening grip. Symptoms of venous thoracic outlet syndrome can include: A change in the color of the hand or one or more fingers. Hand or arm pain and swelling. Symptoms of arterial thoracic outlet syndrome can include: A pulsating lump near the collarbone. Cold fingers, hands or arms. Hand and arm pain. A change in color in one or more of the fingers or the entire hand. Weak or no pulse in the affected arm.

Syphilis,"Primary syphilis Enlarge image Close Primary syphilis Primary syphilis Primary syphilis causes painless sores (chancres) on the genitals, rectum, tongue or lips. The disease can be present with the appearance of a single chancre (shown here on a penis) or many. Syphilis develops in stages. The symptoms vary with each stage. But the stages may overlap. And the symptoms don't always happen in the same order. You may be infected with syphilis bacteria without noticing any symptoms for years. Primary syphilis The first symptom of syphilis is a small sore called a chancre (SHANG-kur). The sore is often painless. It appears at the spot where the bacteria entered your body. Most people with syphilis develop only one chancre. Some people get more than one. The chancre often forms about three weeks after you come in contact with syphilis bacteria. Many people who have syphilis don't notice the chancre. That's because it's usually painless. It also may be hidden within the vagina or rectum. The chancre heals on its own within 3 to 6 weeks. Secondary syphilis You may get a rash while the first chancre heals or a few weeks after it heals. A rash caused by syphilis: Often is not itchy. May look rough, red or reddish-brown. Might be so faint that it's hard to see. The rash often starts on the trunk of the body. That includes the chest, stomach area, pelvis and back. In time, it also could appear on the limbs, the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. Along with the rash, you may have symptoms such as: Wartlike sores in the mouth or genital area. Hair loss. Muscle aches. Fever. Sore throat. Tiredness, also called fatigue. Weight loss. Swollen lymph nodes. Symptoms of secondary syphilis may go away on their own. But without treatment, they could come and go for months or years. Latent syphilis If you aren't treated for syphilis, the disease moves from the secondary stage to the latent stage. This also is called the hidden stage because you have no symptoms. The latent stage can last for years. Your symptoms may never come back. But without treatment, the disease might lead to major health problems, also called complications. Tertiary syphilis After the latent stage, up to 30% to 40% of people with syphilis who don't get treatment have complications known as tertiary syphilis. Another name for it is late syphilis. The disease may damage the: Brain. Nerves. Eyes. Heart. Blood vessels. Liver. Bones and joints. These problems may happen many years after the original, untreated infection. Syphilis that spreads At any stage, untreated syphilis can affect the brain, spinal cord, eyes and other body parts. This can cause serious or life-threatening health problems. Congenital syphilis Pregnant people who have syphilis can pass the disease to their babies. Unborn babies can become infected through the organ that provides nutrients and oxygen in the womb, called the placenta. Infection also can happen during birth. Newborns with congenital syphilis might have no symptoms. But without fast treatment, some babies might get: Sores and rashes on the skin. Fever. A type of discolored skin and eyes, called jaundice. Not enough red blood cells, called anemia. Swollen spleen and liver. Sneezing or stuffed, drippy nose, called rhinitis. Bone changes. Later symptoms may include deafness, teeth problems and saddle nose, a condition in which the bridge of the nose collapses. Babies with syphilis also can be born too early. They may die in the womb before birth. Or they could die after birth. When to see a doctor Call a member of your health care team if you or your child has any symptoms of syphilis. These could include any unusual discharge, a sore or a rash, especially in the groin area. Also get tested for syphilis if you: Have had sexual contact with someone who might have the disease. Have another sexually transmitted disease such as HIV. Are pregnant. Regularly have sex with more than one partner. Have unprotected sex, meaning sex without a condom. Mayo Clinic Minute: Signs and symptoms of syphilis Show transcript for video Mayo Clinic Minute: Signs and symptoms of syphilis Vivien Williams: Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. Dr. Stacey Rizza, an infectious diseases specialist at Mayo Clinic, says syphilis affects men and women and can present in various stages. Stacey Rizza, M.D.: Primary syphilis causes an ulcer, and this sometimes isn't noticed because it's painless and can be inside the vagina or on the cervix…after a few weeks, two months, they can get secondary syphilis, which is a rash. Vivien Williams: It may then progress to latent stage syphilis and, finally, the most serious stage: tertiary. Pregnant women are not immune to syphilis. Congenital syphilis can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth or infant deaths. That's why all pregnant women should be screened. Syphilis is preventable and treatable. As for prevention, Dr. Rizza recommends barrier protection during sex. Dr. Rizza: And that's during oral sex, anal sex, vaginal sex — using condoms, dental dams and any other barrier protection.

Sorry something went wrong with your subscription Please, try again in a couple of minutes Retry Causes Breast lumps can be caused by: Breast cysts. These fluid-filled sacs inside the breast are round, smooth and firm. A breast cyst can range in size from a few millimeters to as large as an orange. The tissue around it may be tender. A breast cyst may appear before your period and get smaller, larger or go away afterward. Breast cysts tend to come on quickly around the time of the menstrual cycle. Fibrocystic breast changes. With these changes, you may feel general fullness in your breasts. Some areas may be lumpy or ropelike. Your breasts may feel tender. It's common to have fibrocystic breast changes related to the menstrual cycle. The symptoms tend to get better after you have your period. Fibroadenomas. These solid breast tumors aren't cancer. They're smooth, and they move easily under the skin when touched. A fibroadenoma may get smaller over time or it may grow larger. Factors that may be linked with fibroadenoma growth include being pregnant, using hormone therapy such as birth control pills or having a period. Injury or post-surgery. A serious injury to breast tissue or a complication after breast surgery can create a breast lump. This is called fat necrosis. Infections. A collection of infected fluid called an abscess in breast tissue also can cause a breast lump. The lump often is linked with breast pain, redness in that area and swelling of the skin. Intraductal papilloma. This is a skin tag-like growth in a milk duct. It can cause the nipple to leak clear or bloody fluid. It's usually not painful. This growth can be seen on a breast ultrasound of the area under the nipple. Lipoma. This type of lump can feel soft. It involves fatty breast tissue. It's often harmless. Breast cancer. A breast lump that's painless, hard, has irregular edges and is different from the breast tissue around it might be breast cancer. The skin covering the lump may thicken, change color or look red. There also may be skin changes such as dimpled or pitted areas that look like the skin of an orange. Your breast size and shape may change. You may notice fluid leaking from the nipple, or the nipple may turn inward. The lymph nodes under the arm or near the collarbone might be swollen. See your healthcare professional to learn what kinds of tests you might need and which type of breast lump you have. Risk factors Risk factors for breast lumps caused by conditions that are not cancer include the following: Age. Some conditions that cause breast lumps are more common in the 30s and 40s. These include fibrocystic changes and fibroadenomas. Menstrual periods. Before or during your period, you may feel a breast lump due to extra fluid in the breasts. Pregnancy. Your breasts may feel lumpy during pregnancy. That's because the glands that make milk grow in number and get larger. Premenopause. As you get closer to menopause, hormone changes might make your breasts feel lumpier and tender. Some risk factors for breast cancer are within your control to change. These include: Alcohol. The more alcohol you drink, the higher the risk of breast cancer. Overweight or obesity. The risk of breast cancer rises if you're overweight or obese after menopause. A lack of exercise. If you don't get physical activity, it may make you more likely to get breast cancer. Not giving birth. The risk of breast cancer is slightly higher in people who haven't had children or who didn't have children until after age 30. Not breastfeeding. The risk of breast cancer may be slightly higher in people who don't breastfeed their babies. Hormonal birth control. Birth control methods that use hormones to prevent pregnancy may slightly raise breast cancer risk. These include birth control pills, shots and intrauterine devices. Hormone therapy. Long-term use of estrogen combined with progesterone can raise the risk of breast cancer. Other risk factors for cancerous breast lumps can't be controlled. These include: Being born female. Women are much more likely than men to get breast cancer. Aging. The risk of breast cancer rises with age. Most often, tests find breast cancer in people 55 and older. Gene changes. Some types of breast cancer are caused by genes changes passed from parents to children, also called inherited gene changes. A change in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene is the most common cause of inherited breast cancer. Family history of breast cancer. You're more likely to get breast cancer if a close relative such as a parent or sibling also had the disease. Dense breasts. This means your breasts have more glandular and fibrous tissue, and less fatty tissue. People with dense breast tissue have a higher risk of breast cancer than those whose breast density is average. Early menstrual periods or later menopause. Starting your period at an early age, especially before 12, is linked with a slightly higher breast cancer risk. Going through menopause after 55 also is tied to a slightly higher risk of breast cancer. Certain breast conditions that aren't cancer. Some benign breast conditions that cause lumps can make breast cancer more likely later on. These conditions include atypical ductal hyperplasia and atypical lobular hyperplasia, which involve too much cell growth in certain breast cells. Another condition called lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) happens when cells grow in glands that make breast milk. LCIS also can raise the risk for breast cancer. Complications Some conditions that cause breast lumps may lead to other health concerns, also called complications. The complications depend on the type of breast lump that you have. For example, without treatment, some breast infections can cause pockets of pus to form in the breast. Other breast conditions that are not cancer still can raise the risk of breast cancer later on. These include conditions that can cause lumps, such as atypical ductal hyperplasia, atypical lobular hyperplasia and lobular carcinoma in situ. If you have a breast condition that raises the risk of cancer, it doesn't mean that you'll definitely get breast cancer. Ask your healthcare professional what the risk means for you and whether you can make lifestyle changes to lower it. Some breast lumps don't cause complications. For example, small cysts and simple fibroadenomas sometimes go away on their own over time. Prevention There's no clear way to prevent many breast lumps. Breast lumps that are not cancer often are linked with natural changes in the body, such as hormonal changes over time. But some risk factors for cancerous breast lumps are within your power to change. Take the following steps to lower your chances of breast cancer: Drink less alcohol. If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men. Eat a balanced diet. Fill your plate with lean proteins, whole grains, and fruits and vegetables. Eat less sugary, salty and processed foods. Exercise. The American Cancer Society recommends that adults aim to get 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise a week. Or you can try to do 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous activity a week. If you're not active now, ask your healthcare professional to help you get started.

Supraventricular tachycardia,"The main symptom of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a very fast heartbeat that may last for a few minutes to a few days. The heart beats 100 or more times a minute. Usually during SVT , the heart beats 150 to 220 times a minute. The fast heartbeat may come and go suddenly. Symptoms of supraventricular tachycardia may include: Pounding or fluttering feelings in the chest, called palpitations. A pounding sensation in the neck. Chest pain. Fainting or almost fainting. Lightheadedness or dizziness. Shortness of breath. Sweating. Weakness or extreme tiredness. Some people with SVT do not notice symptoms. In infants and very young children, symptoms of SVT may be vague. The symptoms can include sweating, poor feeding, a change in skin color and a rapid pulse. If your infant or young child has any of these symptoms, talk with a healthcare professional. When to see a doctor Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is usually not life-threatening unless you have heart damage or another heart condition. But if SVT is severe, the irregular heartbeat may cause all heart activity to suddenly stop. This is called sudden cardiac arrest. Call a healthcare professional if you have a very fast heartbeat for the first time or if an irregular heartbeat lasts longer than a few seconds. Symptoms of SVT may be related to a serious health condition. Call 911 or your local emergency number if you have a very fast heartbeat that lasts for more than a few minutes or if a fast heartbeat occurs with these symptoms: Chest pain. Dizziness. Shortness of breath. Weakness. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Sunburn,"Sunburn symptoms can include: Inflamed skin, which looks pink or red on white skin and may be harder to see on brown or Black skin. Skin that feels warm or hot to the touch. Pain, tenderness and itching. Swelling. Small, fluid-filled blisters, which may break. Headache, fever, nausea and fatigue, if the sunburn is severe. Eyes that feel painful or gritty. Any exposed part of the body — including the earlobes, scalp and lips — can burn. Even covered areas can burn if, for example, clothing has a loose weave that allows ultraviolet (UV) light through. The eyes, which are extremely sensitive to the sun's UV light, also can burn. Sunburn symptoms often appear within a few hours after sun exposure. Within a few days, the body may start to heal itself by peeling the damaged skin's top layer. A bad sunburn may take several days to heal. Any lingering changes in skin color usually go away with time. When to see a doctor See your health care provider if you: Develop large blisters. Develop blisters on the face, hands or genitals. Experience severe swelling of the affected area. Show signs of infection, such as blisters with pus or streaks. Experience worsening pain, headache, confusion, nausea, fever or chills. Get worse despite at-home care. Have eye pain or vision changes. Seek immediate medical care if you are sunburned and experience: A fever over 103 F (39.4 C) with vomiting. Confusion. An infection. Dehydration. Cold skin, dizziness or faintness. Request an appointment"
Sun allergy,"Polymorphous light eruption on the chest Enlarge image Close Polymorphous light eruption on the chest Polymorphous light eruption on the chest Polymorphous light eruption is a rash that affects parts of the body that are exposed to more sunlight as daylight hours get longer, such as the front of the neck and chest. Polymorphous means that the rash can have many forms, such as tiny bumps, raised areas or blisters. How skin with sun allergy looks varies widely depending on the color of your skin and what's causing the symptoms. Signs and symptoms may include: Itchiness (pruritus) Stinging Tiny bumps that may merge into raised patches A flushing of the exposed area Blisters or hives Symptoms usually occur only on skin that has been exposed to the sun or other source of UV light.

Staph infections,
Stuttering,"Stuttering symptoms may include: Having a hard time starting a word, phrase or sentence. Stretching out a word or sounds within a word. Repeating a sound, syllable or word. Brief silence for certain syllables or words, or pausing before or within a word. Adding extra words such as ""um"" if expecting to have problems moving to the next word. A lot of tension, tightness or movement of the face or upper body when saying a word. Anxiety about talking. Not being able to communicate well with others. These actions may happen when stuttering: Rapid eye blinks. Trembling of the lips or jaw. Unusual face movements, sometimes called facial tics. Head nodding. Tightening of fists. Stuttering may be worse when the person is excited, tired or under stress, or when feeling self-conscious, hurried or pressured. Situations such as speaking in front of a group or talking on the phone can be especially hard for people who stutter. But most people who stutter can speak without stuttering when they talk to themselves and when they sing or speak along with someone else. When to see a doctor or speech-language pathologist It's common for children between the ages of 2 and 5 years to go through periods when they may stutter. For most children, this is part of learning to speak, and it gets better on its own. But stuttering that continues may need treatment to improve speech fluency. Call your healthcare professional for a referral to a specialist in speech and language called a speech-language pathologist. Or you can contact the speech-language pathologist directly for an appointment. Ask for help if stuttering: Lasts more than six months. Happens along with other speech or language problems. Happens more often or continues as the child grows older. Includes muscle tightening or physically struggling when trying to speak. Affects the ability to effectively communicate at school or work or in social situations. Causes anxiety or emotional problems, such as fear of or not taking part in situations that require speaking. Begins as an adult. Request an appointment"

Spinal cord tumor,"Spinal cord tumors may not cause signs and symptoms at first. When symptoms happen, they might start in the part of the spine near the tumor. As a spinal cord tumor grows, it can hurt nearby nerves and cause symptoms in other parts of the body. In the spine, spinal cord tumor symptoms include: Pain near the spot where the tumor forms. Pain that feels worse at night. Pain that feels like it extends or shoots from the back to nearby areas. Pain that gets worse over time. A spinal cord tumor that grows to hurt the nearby nerves can cause symptoms that happen along those nerves. Symptoms may include: Changes in feeling in one part of the body, such as being less sensitive to pain, heat and cold. Loss of bowel or bladder function. Muscle weakness in one part of the body. Trouble with walking, which can lead to falls. Spinal cord tumors happen rarely in children. Symptoms of spinal cord tumors in children include: A new curve in the spine. Back or neck pain that often is worse at night. Changes in the way the child walks, including falling and tripping more than usual. Loss of mobility. For example, a child who learned to walk may seem to prefer crawling. A child who learned to stand may no longer try to stand. Muscle weakness.

Spinal arteriovenous malformation (AVM),"Symptoms of a spinal arteriovenous malformation (AVM) can differ from person to person. Symptoms depend on where the AVM is found and how serious it is. Some people may not notice symptoms for many years, if at all. Others may experience symptoms that are life-threatening. Symptoms often begin when people are in their 20s but can occur at earlier or later ages. Some people are diagnosed under the age of 16. Symptoms may start suddenly or slowly and may include: Trouble walking or climbing stairs. Numbness, tingling or sudden pain in the legs. Weakness on one or both sides of the body. As the condition gets worse, you may have more symptoms including: Sudden, serious back pain. Lack of feeling in the legs. Trouble urinating or having bowel movements. Headache. Stiff neck. When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your healthcare professional if you experience symptoms of a spinal AVM . Request an appointment"
Spina bifida,"Symptoms of spina bifida vary by type and from one person to another. Spina bifida occulta. Typically, there aren't any symptoms of spina bifida occulta because the spinal nerves aren't involved. But you can sometimes see symptoms on the newborn's skin above the small gap in the spine. You might see a tuft of hair, a small dimple or a birthmark. Sometimes, these skin marks can be symptoms of a spinal cord issue that can be found with MRI or a spinal ultrasound in a newborn. Meningocele. This type may affect bladder and bowel function. Myelomeningocele. In this most serious type of spina bifida, the spinal canal remains open along several vertebrae in the lower or middle back. The membranes and part of the spinal cord or nerves protrude at birth, forming a sac. Tissues and nerves usually are exposed, though sometimes skin covers the sac. Babies with this type of spina bifida may have trouble with bladder and bowel function. They also may experience weakness or lack of movement in the legs. Babies may have a buildup of fluid in the brain called hydrocephalus that can put pressure on brain tissue. When to see a doctor Typically, myelomeningocele is diagnosed before or right after birth, when medical care is available. Children diagnosed with this condition should be followed by a specialized team of healthcare professionals throughout their lives. Families can be educated on the different complications to watch for. Children with spina bifida occulta typically don't have symptoms or complications. In these children, usually only routine pediatric care is needed. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Spider bites,
Specific phobias,"A specific phobia involves a strong, lasting fear of a certain object or situation that's much greater than the actual risk. There are many types of phobias. It's common to have a specific phobia about more than one object or situation. Specific phobias also can happen along with other types of anxiety disorders. Common types of specific phobias are fears of: Situations, such as airplanes, driving, enclosed spaces or going to school. Nature, such as thunderstorms, heights or the dark. Animals or insects, such as dogs, snakes or spiders. Blood, shots or injuries, such as needles, accidents or medical procedures. Others, such as choking, throwing up, loud noises or clowns. Each specific phobia has a name. Phobia comes from the Greek word ""phobos,"" which means fear. Examples of more common names include acrophobia for the fear of heights and claustrophobia for the fear of confined spaces. No matter what specific phobia you have, you may: Feel intense fear, anxiety and panic right away when exposed to or even thinking about what causes your fear. Know that your fears are not reasonable or not as big as you think they are, but you cannot control them. Have anxiety that gets worse as the situation or object gets closer to you physically or in time. Do everything possible to stay away from an object or situation or face it with extreme anxiety or fear. Have trouble with daily activities because of your fear. Have physical reactions and feelings, including sweating, rapid heartbeat, tight chest or trouble breathing. Feel like throwing up, or you get dizzy or faint, especially around blood or injuries. Children may have tantrums, or they may cling, cry or refuse to leave a parent's side or approach their fear. When to see a doctor An extreme fear can make life hard — for example, taking long flights of stairs instead of an elevator. But it is not a specific phobia unless it seriously disrupts your life. If anxiety negatively affects the way you act at work or school, or in social situations, talk with your doctor or another health care professional, or a mental health professional. Childhood fears, such as fear of the dark, monsters or of being left alone, are common. Most children outgrow them. But if your child has an ongoing, strong fear that interferes with how they act at school or work daily, talk to your child's doctor. The right therapy can help most people. And the sooner you ask for help, the more likely that therapy will be effective. Request an appointment"
Somatic symptom disorder,"Symptoms of somatic symptom disorder may be: Specific sensations, such as pain or shortness of breath, or more general symptoms, such as fatigue or weakness Unrelated to any medical cause that can be identified, or related to a medical condition such as cancer or heart disease, but more significant than what's usually expected A single symptom, multiple symptoms or varying symptoms Mild, moderate or severe Pain is the most common symptom, but whatever your symptoms, you have excessive thoughts, feelings or behaviors related to those symptoms, which cause significant problems, make it difficult to function and sometimes can be disabling. These thoughts, feelings and behaviors can include: Constant worry about potential illness Viewing normal physical sensations as a sign of severe physical illness Fearing that symptoms are serious, even when there is no evidence Thinking that physical sensations are threatening or harmful Feeling that medical evaluation and treatment have not been adequate Fearing that physical activity may cause damage to your body Repeatedly checking your body for abnormalities Frequent health care visits that don't relieve your concerns or that make them worse Being unresponsive to medical treatment or unusually sensitive to medication side effects Having a more severe impairment than is usually expected from a medical condition For somatic symptom disorder, more important than the specific physical symptoms you experience is the way you interpret and react to the symptoms and how they impact your daily life. When to see a doctor Because physical symptoms can be related to medical problems, it's important to be evaluated by your primary care provider if you aren't sure what's causing your symptoms. If your primary care provider believes that you may have somatic symptom disorder, he or she can refer you to a mental health professional. Caring for a loved one When physical symptoms considered to be somatic symptom disorder occur, it can be difficult to accept that a life-threatening illness has been eliminated as the cause. Symptoms cause very real distress for the person and reassurance isn't always helpful. Encourage your loved one to consider the possibility of a mental health referral to learn ways to cope with the reaction to symptoms and any disability it causes. Physical disability may cause the person to be dependent and need extra physical care and emotional support that can exhaust caregivers and cause stress on families and relationships. If you feel overwhelmed by your role as caregiver, you may want to talk to a mental health professional to address your own needs. Request an appointment"

Snoring,"Snoring is often associated with a sleep disorder called obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Not all snorers have OSA, but if snoring is accompanied by any of the following symptoms, it may be an indication to see a doctor for further evaluation for OSA: Witnessed breathing pauses during sleep Excessive daytime sleepiness Difficulty concentrating Morning headaches Sore throat upon awakening Restless sleep Gasping or choking at night High blood pressure Chest pain at night Your snoring is so loud it's disrupting your partner's sleep In children, poor attention span, behavioral issues or poor performance in school OSA often is characterized by loud snoring followed by periods of silence when breathing stops or nearly stops. Eventually, this reduction or pause in breathing may signal you to wake up, and you may awaken with a loud snort or gasping sound. You may sleep lightly due to disrupted sleep. This pattern of breathing pauses may be repeated many times during the night. People with obstructive sleep apnea usually experience periods when breathing slows or stops at least five times during every hour of sleep. When to see a doctor See your doctor if you have any of the above symptoms. These may indicate your snoring is associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). If your child snores, ask your pediatrician about it. Children can have OSA, too. Nose and throat problems — such as enlarged tonsils — and obesity often can narrow a child's airway, which can lead to your child developing OSA. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Smallpox,"Smallpox Enlarge image Close Smallpox Smallpox These are smallpox sores on the skin. This photograph was taken in Bangladesh in 1974. The first symptoms of smallpox usually appear 12 to 14 days after you're exposed to the smallpox virus. However, the virus can be in your body from 7 to 19 days before you look or feel sick. This time is called the incubation period. After the incubation period, sudden flu-like symptoms occur. These include: Fever Muscle aches Headache Severe fatigue Severe back pain Vomiting, sometimes A few days later, flat, red spots appear on the body. They may start in the mouth and on the tongue and then spread to the skin. The face, arms and legs are often affected first, followed by the torso, hands and feet. Within a day or two, many of the spots turn into small blisters filled with clear fluid. Later, the blisters fill with pus. These sores are called pustules. Scabs form 8 to 9 days later and eventually fall off, leaving deep, pitted scars. Smallpox can be spread from person to person when the rash appears and until the scabs fall off.

Selective IgA deficiency,"Most people with selective IgA deficiency have no symptoms. Some people have illnesses more often than is typical.

Seizures,"Symptoms vary based on the type of seizure. They also can range from mild to serious. Seizure symptoms may include: Short-lived confusion. A staring spell. Jerking movements of the arms and legs that can't be stopped. Loss of consciousness or awareness. Changes in thinking or emotions. These may include fear, anxiety or a feeling of already having lived the moment, called deja vu. Most seizures fall into one of two classes called focal or generalized. The classes are based on how and where the brain activity causing the seizure began. If health professionals don't know how the seizures began, they may say the seizures are of unknown onset. Focal seizures Focal seizures result from electrical activity in one area of the brain. This type of seizure can happen with or without passing out, called losing consciousness. Focal seizures with impaired awareness. These seizures involve a change or loss of consciousness or awareness that feels like being in a dream. During these types of seizures, people may seem awake. But they stare into space and don't respond to anything around them. They may repeat movements such as hand rubbing and mouth movements, repeat certain words, or walk in circles. They may not remember the seizure or even know that it happened. Focal seizures without impaired awareness. These seizures may change emotions. They also may change how things look, smell, feel, taste or sound. But people having a focal seizure don't pass out. During these types of seizures, people may feel angry, joyful or sad. Some people have nausea or odd feelings that are hard to describe. These seizures may cause trouble speaking and jerking of a body part such as an arm or a leg. They also may cause sudden symptoms such as tingling, dizziness and seeing flashing lights. Symptoms of focal seizures may seem like those of other conditions of the brain or nervous system. These other conditions include migraine, mental illness or a condition that affects how the brain manages sleep-wake cycles, called narcolepsy. Generalized seizures Seizures that appear to involve all areas of the brain from the time they start are called generalized seizures. Types of generalized seizures include: Absence seizures. Absence seizures often happen in children. These seizures once were called petit mal seizures. People who have absence seizures most often stare into space or make slight body movements such as eye blinking or lip smacking. The seizures most often last for 5 to 10 seconds. Absence seizures can happen up to hundreds of times a day. They can come in clusters. And they can cause a brief loss of awareness. Tonic seizures. Tonic seizures cause muscles to get stiff. These seizures most often affect muscles in the back, arms and legs. People who have these seizures may pass out and fall to the ground. Atonic seizures. Atonic seizures cause a sudden loss of muscle use, most often in the legs. They're also called drop seizures. People having this type of seizure may collapse. Clonic seizures. Clonic seizures are linked with jerking muscle movements. These seizures usually affect the neck, face and arms on both sides of the body. Myoclonic seizures. Myoclonic seizures most often cause sudden brief jerks or twitches of the arms and legs. People who have these seizures don't often pass out. Tonic-clonic seizures. Tonic-clonic seizures are the most common type of generalized seizure. They once were called grand mal seizures. They can cause passing out, body stiffness and shaking. They sometimes cause people to urinate or to bite their tongues. Tonic-clonic seizures last for several minutes. Tonic-clonic seizures may start as focal seizures that spread to involve most or all of the brain. Seizure stages Seizures can have a beginning phase, a middle phase and an end phase. These phases also are called prodrome, ictal and postictal. Prodrome. This is the earliest warning that a seizure may happen. During the prodrome, people may have a hard-to-describe sense that a seizure may happen. They also may have changes in behavior. This can happen in the hours or even days before a seizure. The prodrome stage may include an aura. The aura is the first symptom of a seizure. Symptoms during the aura may include the feeling that a person or place is familiar, called deja vu, or a feeling that a person or place is not familiar. Or people may simply feel strange, feel fear or panic, or even have good feelings. Symptoms also may include smells, sounds, tastes, blurred vision or racing thoughts. Most often, auras are feelings that are hard to describe. The prodrome may include headache, numbness, tingling, nausea or dizziness. Many people with seizures have a prodrome or aura. But some people do not. Ictal phase. The ictal phase lasts from the first symptom, including the aura, to the end of the seizure. Symptoms of the ictal phase depend on the type of seizure. Postictal phase. This is the period after a seizure during recovery. The postictal stage can last minutes or hours. Some people recover quickly, while others take hours. The length of the postictal phase depends on the type of seizure and what part of the brain was affected. During this phase, people may be slow to respond, have trouble with memory, and have trouble talking or writing. They may feel sleepy, confused, dizzy, sad, scared, anxious or frustrated. They also may have nausea, a headache or weakness. They may feel thirsty or urinate. When to see a doctor Seek medical help right away if you have a seizure or if you see someone have a seizure and any of the following happens: The seizure lasts more than five minutes. The person isn't breathing after the seizure stops. A second seizure follows right away. The person has a high fever. The person's body overheats, called heat exhaustion. The person is pregnant. The person has diabetes. The seizure causes an injury. The seizure happens in water. The first time you have a seizure, see a healthcare professional.

Temporal lobe seizure,"An odd feeling called an aura may happen before a temporal lobe seizure. An aura acts as a warning. Not everyone who has temporal lobe seizures has auras. And not everyone who has auras remembers them. The aura is the first part of a focal seizure before a loss of consciousness. Examples of auras include: A sudden sense of fear or joy. A feeling that what's happening has happened before, known as deja vu. A sudden or strange odor or taste. A rising feeling in the belly that feels like being on a roller coaster Sometimes temporal lobe seizures keep people from responding to others. This type of temporal lobe seizure most often lasts 30 seconds to 2 minutes. Symptoms of a temporal lobe seizure include: Not being aware of the people and things around you. Staring. Lip smacking. Swallowing or chewing over and over. Finger movements, such as picking motions. After a temporal lobe seizure, you may: Be confused and have trouble speaking for a time. Be unable to recall what happened during the seizure. Be unaware of having had a seizure. Be very sleepy. Sometimes, what starts as a temporal lobe seizure becomes a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. This type of seizure causes shaking, known as convulsions, and loss of consciousness. It also is called a grand mal seizure. When to see a doctor Call 911 or your local emergency number if: The seizure lasts more than five minutes. Breathing or consciousness doesn't return after the seizure stops. A second seizure follows right away. Recovery isn't complete after the seizure. Recovery is slower than usual after the seizure. You're pregnant. You have diabetes. An injury happens during the seizure. For a first seizure, see a healthcare professional. Seek medical advice if: You think you or your child has had a seizure. You have more seizures or more-intense seizures. You have new seizure symptoms. Request an appointment There is a problem with information submitted for this request.

The muscles suddenly get stiff and cause the person to fall down. Loss of consciousness occurs. This phase tends to last about 10 to 20 seconds. Clonic phase. The muscles go into rhythmic contractions. The arms and legs often jerk. They alternately flex and relax. Convulsions usually last 1 to 2 minutes or less. The following symptoms occur in some but not all people with tonic-clonic seizures: Loss of bowel and bladder function. This may happen during or following a seizure.

Scrotal masses,"Male reproductive system Enlarge image Close Male reproductive system Male reproductive system The male reproductive system makes, stores and moves sperm. Testicles produce sperm. Fluid from the seminal vesicles and prostate gland mixes with sperm to make semen. The penis ejaculates semen during sexual activity. Symptoms of scrotal masses vary. Some cause pain and others don't. It depends on the cause. Symptoms of a scrotal mass might include: An unusual lump. Sudden pain. Dull aching or a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum. Pain that spreads all over the groin, stomach area or lower back. A tender, swollen or hardened testicle or epididymis (ep-ih-DID-uh-miss). The epididymis is the soft, comma-shaped tube above and behind the testicle that stores and transports sperm. Swelling in the scrotum. A change in color of the skin of the scrotum. Upset stomach or vomiting. If an infection causes a scrotal mass, symptoms also might include: Fever. Needing to pee often. Pus or blood in the urine. When to see a doctor Get emergency medical care if you have sudden pain in your scrotum. Some problems need to be treated right away to help prevent permanent damage to a testicle. See a health care professional if you notice a lump in your scrotum or other unusual changes. Get a checkup even if you have a mass that isn't painful or tender. Some scrotal masses are more common in children. See your child's pediatrician or other health care professional if: Your child has symptoms of a scrotal mass. You have any concerns about your child's genitals. A testicle is ""missing."" Sometimes, a testicle doesn't move down from the stomach area into the scrotum before birth. This is called an undescended testicle. It might raise the risk of some scrotal masses later in life. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Scorpion sting,"Symptoms at the site of a scorpion sting may include: Pain, which can be intense. Numbness and tingling. Slight swelling. Warmth. Symptoms from venom that affect the whole body — usually in children who are stung — include: A hard time breathing. Muscle twitching or thrashing. Unusual head, neck and eye movements. Drooling. Sweating. Slurred speech. Nausea and vomiting. High blood pressure (hypertension). Fast heart rate (tachycardia). Being restless or excitable, or crying in children that can't be comforted. As with other stinging insects, such as bees and wasps, it is possible for people who have been stung by scorpions before to have allergic reactions when stung later. Reactions to these later stings are sometimes serious enough to cause a life-threatening condition called anaphylaxis. Symptoms in these cases are like those of anaphylaxis caused by bee stings, including hives, trouble breathing, and nausea and vomiting. When to see a doctor Contact your local poison control center at once if a child is stung by a scorpion. To reach a poison control center in the U.S., call Poison Help at 800-222-1222 . Also, seek medical care if you've been stung and begin to have a hard time breathing or other symptoms that continue for more than a week. If you're concerned about a scorpion sting, you also can call your local poison control center for advice. Request an appointment"
Sclerosing mesenteritis,"Symptoms of sclerosing mesenteritis include pain in the belly, vomiting, bloating, diarrhea and fever. Sometimes people don't have any symptoms."
Scleroderma,"Scleroderma symptoms vary from person to person, depending on which parts of the body are affected. Skin-related symptoms Nearly everyone who has scleroderma experiences hardening and tightening of the skin. The first parts of the body to be affected are usually the fingers, hands, feet and face. In some people, the skin thickening also can involve the forearms, upper arms, chest, abdomen, lower legs and thighs. Early symptoms may include swelling and itchiness. The color of affected skin can become lighter or darker, and skin may look shiny because of the tightness. Some people also have small red spots, called telangiectasia, on their hands and face. Calcium deposits can form under the skin, particularly at the fingertips, causing bumps that can be seen on X-rays. Raynaud's phenomenon Raynaud's phenomenon is common in scleroderma. It happens because of an exaggerated contraction of the small blood vessels in the fingers and toes in response to cold temperatures or emotional distress. When this happens, the digits may feel painful or numb and turn white, blue, gray or red. Raynaud's phenomenon also can occur in people who don't have scleroderma. Digestive symptoms Scleroderma can affect any part of the digestive system, from the esophagus to the rectum. Depending on which parts of the digestive system are affected, symptoms may include: Heartburn. Difficulty swallowing. Bloating. Diarrhea. Constipation. Fecal incontinence. Heart- and lung-related symptoms When scleroderma affects the heart or lungs, it can cause shortness of breath, decreased exercise tolerance and dizziness. Scleroderma can cause scarring in the lung tissues that may result in increasing shortness of breath over time. There are medicines that may help slow the progression of this lung damage. Scleroderma also can cause the blood pressure to increase in the circulation that goes between the heart and the lungs. This is called pulmonary hypertension. In addition to causing shortness of breath, pulmonary hypertension also can cause excess fluid to build up in the legs, feet and sometimes around the heart. When scleroderma affects the heart, heartbeats can become irregular. Heart failure also may happen in some people. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Sciatica,"Sciatica pain can be almost anywhere along the nerve pathway. It's especially likely to follow a path from the low back to the buttock and the back of a thigh and calf. The pain can vary from a mild ache to a sharp, burning pain. Sometimes it feels like a jolt or electric shock. It can be worse when coughing or sneezing or sitting a long time. Usually, sciatica affects only one side of the body. Some people also have numbness, tingling, or muscle weakness in the leg or foot. One part of the leg can be in pain, while another part can feel numb. When to see a doctor Mild sciatica usually goes away over time. Call your primary care professional if self-care measures don't ease symptoms. Also call if pain lasts longer than a week, is severe or gets worse. Get immediate medical care for: Sudden numbness or muscle weakness in a leg. Pain after a violent injury, such as a traffic accident. Trouble controlling bowels or bladder.

Spinal cord injury,"Spinal cord injuries Enlarge image Close Spinal cord injuries Spinal cord injuries Paralysis of the lower half of the body is called paraplegia. Paralysis below the neck, including both arms and legs, is called quadriplegia. The ability to control your arms or legs after a spinal cord injury depends on two factors. One factor is where the injury occurred on the spinal cord. The other factor is how bad the injury is. The lowest part of the spinal cord not damaged after an injury is known as the neurological level of the injury. ""The completeness"" of the injury refers to how much feeling, known as sensation, is lost. Completeness is classified as: Complete. If all feeling and all ability to control movement are lost below the spinal cord injury, the injury is called complete. Incomplete. If some feeling and control of movement remain below the affected area, the injury is called incomplete. There are varying degrees of incomplete injury. Loss of feeling and control of movement is known as paralysis. Paralysis from a spinal cord injury can be referred to as: Tetraplegia, also known as quadriplegia. This means that your arms, hands, trunk, legs and pelvic organs are all affected by your spinal cord injury. Paraplegia. This paralysis affects all or part of the trunk, legs and pelvic organs but not the arms. Your healthcare team performs a series of tests to determine the neurological level and completeness of your injury. Spinal cord injuries can cause the following symptoms: Loss of movement. Loss of or a change in sensation. This includes a change in the ability to feel heat, cold and touch. Loss of bowel or bladder control. Exaggerated reflex activities or spasms. Changes in sexual function, sexual sensitivity and fertility. Pain or an intense stinging sensation caused by damage to the nerve fibers in the spinal cord. Trouble breathing, coughing or clearing secretions from the lungs. Emergency symptoms Emergency symptoms of a spinal cord injury after an accident include: Extreme back pain or pressure in the neck, head or back. Weakness, incoordination or loss of control in any part of the body. Numbness, tingling or loss of feeling in the hands, fingers, feet or toes. Loss of bladder or bowel control. Trouble with balance and walking. Trouble breathing after injury. A twisted neck or back. When to see a doctor Anyone who has an injury to the head or neck needs an immediate medical evaluation. It is safest to assume that the person has a spinal injury until proved otherwise. This is important because: A serious spinal injury is not always immediately obvious. If a spinal injury occurs but it is not known, worse injury may occur. Numbness or paralysis can happen quickly or come on gradually. The time between injury and treatment can be critical. Learning the level of the injury can help determine the possible recovery. If you suspect that someone has a back or neck injury: Do not move the injured person. Permanent paralysis and other serious complications can result. Call 911 or local emergency medical help. Keep the person still. Place heavy towels on both sides of the neck. Or hold the head and neck to prevent them from moving until emergency medical help arrives. Provide basic first aid, such as stopping bleeding and making the person comfortable, without moving the head or neck. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Schizophrenia,"Schizophrenia involves a range of problems in how people think, feel and behave. Symptoms may include: Delusions. This is when people believe in things that aren't real or true. For example, people with schizophrenia could think that they're being harmed or harassed when they aren't. They could think that they're the target for certain gestures or comments when they aren't. They may think they're very famous or have great ability when that's not the case. Or they could feel that a major disaster is about to occur when that's not true. Most people with schizophrenia have delusions. Hallucinations. These usually involve seeing or hearing things that other people don't observe. For people with schizophrenia, these things seem real. Hallucinations can occur with any of the senses, but hearing voices is most common. Disorganized speech and thinking. Disorganized speech causes disorganized thinking. It can be hard for people with schizophrenia to talk with other people. The answers people with schizophrenia give to questions may not be related to what's being asked. Or questions may not be answered fully. Rarely, speech may include putting together unrelated words in a way that can't be understood. Sometimes this is called word salad. Extremely disorganized or unusual motor behavior. This may show in several ways, from childlike silliness to being agitated for no reason. Behavior isn't focused on a goal, so it's hard to do tasks. People with schizophrenia may not want to follow instructions. They may move in ways that are not typical or not appropriate to the social setting. Or they may not move much or respond at all. Negative symptoms. People with schizophrenia may not be able to function in the way they could before their illness started. For example, they may not bathe, make eye contact or show emotions. They may speak in a monotone voice and not be able to feel pleasure. Also, they may lose interest in everyday activities, socially withdraw and have a hard time planning ahead. Symptoms can vary in type and how severe they are. At times, symptoms may get better or worse. Some symptoms may be present at all times. People with schizophrenia usually are diagnosed in the late teen years to early 30s. In men, schizophrenia symptoms usually start in the late teens to early 20s. In women, symptoms usually begin in the late 20s to early 30s. There also is a group of people — usually women — who are diagnosed later in life. It isn't common for children to be diagnosed with schizophrenia. Symptoms in teenagers Schizophrenia symptoms in teenagers are like those in adults, but the condition may be harder to pinpoint. That's because some early symptoms of schizophrenia — those that occur before hallucinations, delusions and disorganization — are commonly seen in many teens, such as: Withdrawing from friends and family. Not doing well in school. Having trouble sleeping. Feeling irritable or depressed. Lacking motivation. Also, the use of recreational drugs, such as marijuana, stimulants like cocaine and methamphetamines, or hallucinogens, can cause similar symptoms. Compared with adults with schizophrenia, teens with the condition may be less likely to have delusions and more likely to have hallucinations. When to see a doctor People with schizophrenia often don't know that they have a mental condition that needs medical attention. As a result, family or friends often need to get them help. Helping someone who may have schizophrenia If people you know have symptoms of schizophrenia, talk to them about your concerns. While you can't force them to seek help, you can offer encouragement and support. You also can help them find a healthcare professional or mental health professional. If people are a danger to themselves or others, or they don't have food, clothing or shelter, you may need to call 911 in the U.S. or other emergency responders for help. A mental health professional needs to evaluate them. Some people may need an emergency stay in a hospital. Laws on mental health treatment against a person's will vary by state. You can contact community mental health agencies or police departments in your area for details. Suicidal thoughts and behavior Suicidal thoughts and attempts are much higher than average in people with schizophrenia. If a person is in danger of suicide or has made a suicide attempt, make sure that someone stays with that person. Contact a suicide hotline. In the U.S., call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Or use the Lifeline Chat. Services are free and confidential. The Suicide & Crisis Lifeline in the U.S. has a Spanish language phone line at 1-888-628-9454 (toll-free). Proper treatment of schizophrenia can reduce the risk of suicide.

Schizoaffective disorder,"Schizoaffective disorder symptoms may vary from person to person. People with the condition have psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions. They also can have symptoms of a mood disorder. This type of schizophrenia could be the bipolar type, which features bouts of mania and sometimes depression. Or it could be the depressive type, which features bouts of depression. How schizoaffective disorder starts and how it affects people may vary. But defining features include a major bout of depressed or manic mood and at least a two-week period of psychotic symptoms when mood symptoms are not present. Symptoms of schizoaffective disorder depend on the type — bipolar or depressive. Symptoms may include: Delusions — having false, fixed beliefs, despite facts showing that they're not true. Hallucinations, such as hearing voices or seeing things that others don't observe. Disorganized thinking and speech. Bizarre or unusual behavior. Symptoms of depression, such as feeling empty, sad or worthless. Periods of manic mood, with more energy and less need for sleep over several days, and behaviors that are out of character. Having a hard time functioning at work or school or in social situations. Problems managing personal care, such as not looking clean and not taking care in how one looks. When to see a doctor If you think someone you know may have schizoaffective disorder symptoms, talk with that person about your concerns. Although you can't force someone to seek professional help, you can offer encouragement and support and help find a healthcare professional or mental health professional. If you're concerned about a loved one's safety or ability to get food, clothing or shelter, you may need to contact emergency responders, a mental health hotline or a social service agency to get help from a mental health professional.

Sarcoidosis,"Symptoms of sarcoidosis vary, depending on which organs are affected and how badly they're affected. Sarcoidosis sometimes develops slowly over time and causes symptoms that last for years. Other times, symptoms appear suddenly and then disappear just as quickly. Many people with sarcoidosis have no symptoms, so the condition is found only when a chest X-ray is done for another reason. General symptoms Sarcoidosis can begin with these symptoms: Extreme tiredness. Slight fever. Swollen lymph nodes, such as in the chest, neck, armpits or groin. Weight loss. Pain and swelling in joints, such as the ankles. Lung symptoms Sarcoidosis most often affects the lungs and may cause lung problems, such as: Ongoing dry cough. Shortness of breath. A squeaking sound when breathing out, called wheezing. Chest pain. Skin symptoms Sarcoidosis may cause skin problems, which may include: A rash of small, itchy bumps, usually on the head, neck or legs. The rash may be painful. Open sores on the nose, lips, cheeks and ears, called skin lesions. Areas of skin that are darker or lighter in color. Growths under the skin, especially around scars or tattoos. Eye symptoms Sarcoidosis can affect the eyes without causing any symptoms, so it's important to have your eyes checked regularly. When eye symptoms do occur, they may include: Blurred vision. Eye pain. Watery eyes. Burning, itching or dry eyes. Severe redness. Sensitivity to light. Heart symptoms Symptoms related to cardiac sarcoidosis may include: Chest pain. Shortness of breath. Fainting. Heartbeats that aren't regular, called arrhythmias. Rapid or fluttering heartbeats, called palpitations. Swelling caused by extra fluid in the body. Nervous system symptoms Sarcoidosis can cause symptoms related to the brain and nerves, such as: Headaches. Dizziness. Changes in vision. Confusion. Weakness. Nerve pain, numbness or tingling. Seizures. Other symptoms Other symptoms are usually linked with the organs affected. Sarcoidosis can cause granulomas in any part of the body, such as the liver, spleen, muscles, bones and joints, kidneys, and lymph nodes. When to see a doctor See a doctor or other healthcare professional if you have symptoms that may be sarcoidosis. ""My experience at Mayo has helped me be here for my grandkids."" — Jim, patient, sarcoidosis Show transcript for video Jim, patient: We were given two beautiful grandkids there shortly after retirement.  They are two special little girls and that really makes life nice. I never had a symptom until that first day of the actual heart attack. I was 100 percent blocked. Diana, spouse: They put 2 or 3 stents in — the doctors would — and then within months, Jim would have the same kind of symptoms again. Jim: I was in the hospital again and this time, it was open-heart surgery. Diana: Oh, my gosh, when he opened Jim up, he said I've seen something today that I've never seen on anybody. Jim: It was discovered at that time that I had sarcoidosis. Diana: You're going to have to go to the Mayo Clinic. Leslie Cooper, M.D., Mayo Clinic Cardiology: He had rapid re-narrowing to the arteries to his heart after they had placed stents.  In his case, they were related to an autoimmune disease, sarcoidosis. Diana: The treatment, the doctors, the teamwork was unbelievable. Leslie Cooper, M.D.: We took an established drug in another area and applied it for the first time in cardiac sarcoidosis. Diana: It was experimental, but it put that sarcoid into remission and that gave Jim his life back. It turned out to be a really good risk. Jim: I didn't realize that the Mayo Clinic was so accessible. When I go there I have no doubt that I'm going to meet competent people in their work and their field.  That, I think, gives you the confidence to trust that you are going to be okay. My experience at Mayo I think has helped me be here for my grandkids. I'm just so thankful to be here.

Rett syndrome,
Retrograde ejaculation,
Retractile testicle,"Testicles form in the abdomen during fetal development. During the final months of development, the testicles gradually descend into the scrotum. If this descent isn't completed at birth, the testicle usually descends within a few months. If your son has a retractile testicle, the testicle originally descended as it should, but doesn't remain in place. Symptoms of a retractile testicle include: The testicle may be moved by hand from the groin into the scrotum and won't immediately retreat to the groin. The testicle might spontaneously appear in the scrotum and remain there for a time. The testicle might spontaneously disappear again for a time. Retractile testicle is different from undescended testicle (cryptorchidism). An undescended testicle is one that never entered the scrotum. When to see a doctor During regular well-baby checkups and annual childhood checkups, a healthcare professional will examine the testicles to determine if they're descended and appropriately developed. If you believe that your son has a retractile or ascending testicle — or have other concerns about the development of his testicles — see his care professional. The care professional will tell you how often to schedule checkups to monitor changes in the condition. Request an appointment"
Retinal diseases,"Many retinal diseases share some common symptoms. These may include: Seeing floating specks or cobwebs. Blurred or distorted vision in which straight lines can look wavy. Defects in the side vision. Vision loss. You may need to try looking with each eye alone to notice these changes. When to see a doctor It's important to pay attention to any changes in your vision and find care quickly. Seek immediate medical attention if you suddenly have floaters, flashes or reduced vision. These are warning signs of potentially serious retinal disease."
Restless legs syndrome,"The chief symptom of restless legs syndrome is an urge to move the legs. It's common to experience: Uncomfortable sensations that begin while resting. A feeling in the legs typically begins after you've been lying down or sitting for an extended time. It might happen while sitting in a car, airplane or movie theater. Relief with movement. The sensation of RLS lessens with movement. Stretching, jiggling the legs, pacing or walking may improve symptoms. Worsening of symptoms in the evening. Symptoms occur mainly at night. Nighttime leg twitching. RLS may be associated with another, more common condition called periodic limb movement of sleep. This condition causes the legs to twitch and kick during sleep, possibly throughout the night. People typically describe RLS symptoms as compelling, unpleasant feelings in the legs or feet. They usually happen on both sides of the body. Less commonly, the sensations affect the arms. The sensations are felt within the leg rather than on the skin. They're described as: Crawling. Creeping. Pulling. Throbbing. Aching. Itching. Electric. Sometimes the feelings of RLS are hard to explain. People with RLS usually don't describe the condition as a muscle cramp or numbness. They do, however, consistently describe the desire to move the legs. It's common for symptoms to get better and worse. Sometimes symptoms disappear for periods of time, then come back. When to see a doctor Talk with your healthcare professional if you have symptoms of restless legs syndrome. RLS can interfere with your sleep, cause daytime drowsiness and affect your quality of life. Request an appointment There is a problem with

Renal artery stenosis,"Renal artery stenosis often doesn't cause any signs or symptoms until it's advanced. The condition may be discovered incidentally during testing for something else. Your health care provider may also suspect a problem if you have: High blood pressure that begins suddenly or worsens without explanation High blood pressure that begins before age 30 or after age 50 As renal artery stenosis progresses, other signs and symptoms may include: High blood pressure that's hard to control A whooshing sound as blood flows through a narrowed vessel (bruit), which your doctor hears through a stethoscope placed over your kidneys Elevated protein levels in the urine or other signs of a problem with kidney function Worsening kidney function during treatment for high blood pressure Fluid overload and swelling in your body's tissues Treatment-resistant heart failure When to seek medical advice Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any persistent signs or symptoms that worry you. Request an appointment"
Vesicoureteral reflux,"Vesicoureteral reflux symptoms often are due to a urinary tract infection (UTI). A UTI doesn't always cause symptoms, but most people notice some. These symptoms can include: A strong, constant urge to urinate. A burning feeling when urinating. The need to pass small amounts of urine often. Cloudy urine. Fever. Pain in the side, groin or stomach area. Babies and some small children with UTIs can't tell adults what their symptoms feel like. But they may have: A fever for no clear reason. Lack of hunger. Fussiness. As a child gets older, vesicoureteral reflux that doesn't get treated can lead to: Bed-wetting. Constipation or loss of control over bowel movements. High blood pressure. Protein in urine. Urgent need to urinate or urinating more often than usual. Leaking urine by accident, also called urinary incontinence. Another symptom of vesicoureteral reflux is swelling of one or both kidneys. This swelling is called hydronephrosis. It's caused by the backup of urine into the kidneys. An imaging test called an ultrasound often finds this swelling before a baby is born. When to see a doctor Call a healthcare professional right away if your child has any UTI symptoms, such as: A strong, persistent urge to urinate. A burning sensation when urinating. Pain in the stomach area, groin or side. Upset stomach or vomiting. Call your healthcare professional about fever if your child: Is younger than 3 months old and has a rectal temperature of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) or higher. A child 2 months old or younger may need emergency care. Is 3 months or older and has a fever of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) or higher without other symptoms that lasts more than 24 hours. Is also eating poorly, has had major changes in mood, or looks or acts very sick. Request an appointment"
Recurrent breast cancer,"Signs and symptoms of recurrent breast cancer vary depending on where the cancer comes back. Local recurrence In a local recurrence, cancer reappears in the same area as your original cancer. If you've undergone a lumpectomy, the cancer could recur in the remaining breast tissue. If you've undergone a mastectomy, the cancer could recur in the tissue that lines the chest wall or in the skin. Signs and symptoms of local recurrence within the same breast may include: A new lump in your breast or irregular area of firmness. Changes to the skin of your breast. Skin inflammation or area of redness. Nipple discharge. Signs and symptoms of local recurrence on the chest wall after a mastectomy may include: One or more painless nodules on or under the skin of your chest wall. A new area of thickening along or near the mastectomy scar. Regional recurrence A regional breast cancer recurrence means the cancer has come back in the nearby lymph nodes. Signs and symptoms of regional recurrence may include a lump or swelling in the lymph nodes located: Under your arm. Near your collarbone. In the groove above your collarbone. In your neck. Distant recurrence A distant (metastatic) recurrence means the cancer has traveled to distant parts of the body, most commonly the bones, liver and lungs. Signs and symptoms include: Persistent and worsening pain, such as chest, back or hip pain. Persistent cough. Difficulty breathing. Loss of appetite. Weight loss without trying. Severe headaches. Seizures. When to see a doctor After your breast cancer treatment ends, your doctor will likely create a schedule of follow-up exams for you. During follow-up exams, your doctor checks for any symptoms or signs of cancer recurrence. You can also report any new signs or symptoms to your doctor. Make an appointment with your doctor if you notice any persistent signs and symptoms that worry you. Request an appointment There is a problem with information submitted for this request.

                            requested in your inbox. Sorry something went wrong with your subscription Please, try again in a couple of minutes Retry Causes Recurrent breast cancer occurs when cells that were part of your original breast cancer break away from the original tumor and hide nearby in the breast or in another part of your body. Later, these cells begin growing again. The chemotherapy, radiation, hormone therapy or other treatment you may have received after your first breast cancer diagnosis was intended to kill any cancer cells that may have remained after surgery. But sometimes these treatments aren't able to kill all of the cancer cells. Sometimes cancer cells may be dormant for years without causing harm. Then something happens that activates the cells, so they grow and spread to other parts of the body. It's not clear why this occurs. Risk factors For breast cancer survivors, factors that increase the risk of a recurrence include: Lymph node involvement. Finding cancer in nearby lymph nodes at the time of your original diagnosis increases your risk of the cancer coming back. Larger tumor size. People with larger tumors have a greater risk of recurrent breast cancer. Positive or close tumor margins. During breast cancer surgery, the surgeon tries to remove the cancer along with a small amount of the normal tissue that surrounds it. A pathologist examines the edges of the tissue to look for cancer cells. If the borders are free of cancer when examined under a microscope, that's considered a negative margin. If any part of the border has cancer cells (positive margin), or the margin between the tumor and normal tissue is close, the risk of breast cancer recurrence is increased. Lack of radiation treatment following a lumpectomy. Most people who choose a lumpectomy (wide local excision) for breast cancer undergo breast radiation therapy to reduce the risk of recurrence. Those who don't undergo the radiation therapy have an increased risk of local breast cancer recurrence. Younger age. Younger people, particularly those under age 35 at the time of their original breast cancer diagnosis, face a higher risk of recurrent breast cancer. Inflammatory breast cancer. People with inflammatory breast cancer have a higher risk of local recurrence. Lack of endocrine therapy for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. In people who have a certain type of breast cancer, not receiving endocrine therapy can raise their risk of recurrence. Cancer cells with certain characteristics. If you had triple negative breast cancer, you may have an increased risk of breast cancer recurrence. Triple negative breast cancer cells don't have receptors for estrogen or progesterone, and they don't make too much of a protein called HER2. Obesity. Having a higher body mass index increases your risk of recurrence. Prevention Strategies that have been linked to a reduced risk of breast cancer recurrence include: Hormone therapy. Taking hormone therapy after your initial treatment may reduce the risk of recurrence if you have hormone receptor positive breast cancer. Hormone therapy may continue for at least five years. Chemotherapy. For people with breast cancer who have an increased risk of cancer recurrence, chemotherapy has been shown to decrease the chance that cancer will recur, and those who receive chemotherapy live longer. Radiation therapy. People who've had a breast-sparing operation to treat their breast cancer and those who had a large tumor or inflammatory breast cancer have a lower chance of the cancer recurring if they're treated with radiation therapy. Targeted therapy. If your cancer makes extra HER2 protein, drugs that target that protein can help decrease the chance of the cancer recurring. Bone-building drugs. Taking bone-building drugs reduces the risk of cancer recurring in the bones (bone metastasis) in people with an increased risk for breast cancer recurrence. Maintaining a healthy weight. Maintaining a healthy weight may help decrease the risk of recurrent breast cancer. Exercising. Regular exercise may reduce your risk of breast cancer recurrence. Choosing a healthy diet. Focus on including lots of vegetables, fruits and whole grains in your diet. If you choose to drink alcohol, limit yourself to one drink a day.

Raynaud's disease,"Raynaud's disease Enlarge image Close Raynaud's disease Raynaud's disease Raynaud's disease causes smaller blood vessels that supply blood flow to the skin to narrow in response to cold or stress.

Tachycardia,"Some people with tachycardia have no symptoms. The fast heartbeat may be discovered when a physical exam or heart tests are done for another reason. In general, tachycardia may cause these symptoms: Racing, pounding heartbeat or flopping in the chest, called palpitations. Chest pain. Fainting. Lightheadedness. Rapid pulse. Shortness of breath. When to see a doctor Many things can cause tachycardia. If you feel like your heart is beating too fast, make an appointment for a health checkup. Seek immediate medical help if you have: Chest pain or discomfort. Shortness of breath. Weakness. Dizziness or lightheadedness. Fainting or near fainting. A type of tachycardia called ventricular fibrillation is an emergency that requires immediate medical attention. During ventricular fibrillation, blood pressure drops dramatically. The person's breathing and pulse stop because the heart is not pumping any blood to the body. This also is called cardiac arrest. The person usually falls down, also called collapses. If this happens, do the following: Call 911 or the emergency number in your area. Start CPR . CPR helps keep blood flowing to the organs until other treatments can start. If you're not trained in CPR or worried about giving rescue breaths, then provide hands-only CPR . Push hard and fast on the center of the chest at a rate of 100 to 120 compressions a minute until paramedics arrive. The American Heart Association suggests doing compressions to the beat of the song ""Stayin' Alive."" You don't need to do rescue breathing. Have someone get an automated external defibrillator (AED) if one is nearby. An AED is a portable device that delivers a shock to reset the heart rhythm. No training is needed to use the device. The AED tells you what to do. It's programmed to give a shock only when appropriate. Request an appointment There is a problem with
